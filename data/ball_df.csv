Ultra Rubber Ball Tough Dog Toy,"[<span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog LOVES chewing his toys and tearing them apart. Unless I’m getting him a toy that I know is gonna last, I typically buy him the cheapest ones since they won’t last more than 20 minutes. I thought  these balls would only last a day or two max, but we’re going on a week AND THERES NOT EVEN A DENT!! 

He absolutely loves these balls. They’re scented too which I thinks makes him like them even more- but we have an indoor one and an outside one since he cuddles this toy and tries his darn best to chew it. Also, it’s $4 cheaper on chewy than petsmart.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our young pup loves this ball! She is an extreme chewer and does not play traditional ""fetch"". Instead, she loves to have the ball bounced so that she can chase it down and take it somewhere in the yard to chew. We have had this ball for about 2 months and so far no damage. It has outlived every toy other than the extreme medium Kong toy. The ball bounces high and is great for pups that like to pounce. The best toy we have bought for the price.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog was chewing tennis balls, ripping off the soft threads.  Then I got these.  He plays with them all day - either fetching or just chewing.  He's a very hard chewer but I don't think he'll ever destroy these!  They are the size of tennis balls and if they get too dirty or slobbery, they are easy to wash.  I would definately recommend these!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 1 year old pitbull/husky &amp; usually she can go through a tennis ball in 15 mins. Decided to try chuckit! &amp; so far it’s going great. Good bounce &amp; very durable. No holes or teeth marks at all. I chuck the ball in the basement all day &amp; she’ll bring it back looking like it did the day I gave it to her</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Small enough for little mouths of Yorkies. We don’t chuck them, we just bounce them around in the house and the girls chew on them. It has helped with the plaque on the canines, which is a bonus. 
Drawback...
They roll easily under chairs and couches. We are fishing them out several times a day.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Golden Retriever’s favorite toy is his Chuckit Ball!    He sleeps with me and his 4 Chuckit Balls are always there too!    He loves to chew on them and they never show wear or tear!  He is actively 3 years old and loves to run fetch his Chuckit Balls.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 4 year old German shepherd is obsessed with these balls! She loves to play fetch and is almost always carrying one of these around with her. These are the only brand of balls it takes her a while to bust up. She is a power chewer and nothing lasts forever, but these are worth it bc she gets a few months out of them!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pup destroys even the seemingly most durable toys and this ball has survived its first day unscathed. She has spent a few hours working on it and no marks yet. I give this my highest durability rating for being able to survive a single day- that doesn’t often happen with new toys here!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">They never seem to get old! VERY durable, colorful (so you can see it when it gets tossed under furniture) and the right size for a Cavachon to get his mouth around. When they get lost and I order new ones, he's SO pleased with the Chewy's box!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">One of my Border Collies loves to chew up the tennis ball type dog toys, first the fuzzy outer layer and then collapse the entire ball until it falls apart, all while playing catch.  That usually happens within 2 or 3 days.  We play ball 2 or more times a day (alternating with flying disks depending on the wind) so we've gone through lots of balls.  She gave up nibbling the outside of this ball for any fuzz after a day and continues to try to collapse her ball.  She only gets the ball to play with me so does not have any time with the ball by herself.  So two weeks and counting of no destruction.  Great!  (Still ordering a new set of 2 balls just in case these get lost or finally chewed up.)</span>]"

If you don’t like noise, then don’t get this toy. It’s the equivalent of giving a toddler a noisy toy, and your pup will be obsessed. I love seeing how happy he is, and the sound really doesn’t bother me! Especially since he’s been destroying things in the house lately, meaning that whenever I hear the toy, I know he is behaving! He carries it around the house, play bows to it, bats it around to make more noise, it’s incredible. What a happy and engaged pup!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our older lab couldn't care less, our little Pomsky is afraid of it, but our Corgi just goes wild over it! She looks toward the cubby hole where I store it each day when she thinks it's time to play.  I put it down on the floor and she chases it all over the house, pushing it with her nose and barking the entire time.  She only stops when she needs a drink of water or she's just exhausted.  If you have a dog that loves to play and isn't afraid of crazy, wacky sounds, this might be the toy you're looking for.  It seems to be well constructed too, so I expect it to last a while.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the best toy of any we have purchased for our puppy, who is now just over 3 months.  At first, he was a little afraid of it and barked at it after he pushed it around and it made noise.  Then I followed the instructions and said, ""good boy"" each time he made it make a sound.  Right after that, he was pushing it all over, having a blast.  He kept playing long after I walked into the next room.  Within a few minutes, he figured out how to pick it up in his mouth and carry it.  I'd say this one is a hit!!  :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy will keep your larger babies busy for hours.  My boy, Max, loves it.  He will chace it for as long as I will let him. 

The nice thing is it is sturdy and tough.  It won't break easily and last for as long as you take care of it (example: don't run over it). 

My recommendation, if you have a larger dog that likes noise you should buy this for them.  It will be the last noise maker you'll every buy or want to buy for them.  They will love it and you will enjoy watching them have fun with it.  Worth every penny.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pup is a chaser so I thought he would love this. He will chase literally anything normally, even light reflections. However, he did not know what to do with this ball! It became more of a nuisance having to move it around to show him what to do verse a fun activity for him to play with unfortunately. I think there are better interactive toys out there Chewy has to offer than this ball, especially at this price.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have tried this toy a couple times because my dog obsesses over it however if you take your eyes off him for even a minute it’s destroyed he bites through it like butter and he’s only 40 pounds this is supposed to be for dogs well sizes and durable. Great idea but sadly will not be buying again I am worried he will get a blockage from eating the pieces. It took them over five minutes to put this hole in it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a pitbull and he seems to amaze me with how fast he tears toys up. Literally in 5 minutes he normally shreds toys but this one he’s having lots of trouble destroying lmao.. he’s so excited each time it moves and makes a sound 10/10 recommend if you have a big playful dog who seems to destroy everything. This is the toy for them!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 16-year-old Jack Russell mix is mostly blind and deaf. However, he still likes to chase his toys and play with them by himself.  He doesn’t know what to make of this toy. He responds when I roll it, but just sniffs it and walks away. It seems to be too large for him to move and the indentations are too far apart for him to get his mouth around, so he can’t pick it u.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a fun ball for my hyper chewing puppy/dog. At first he was afraid of the sounds, but the more we laughed, the easier it became for him to play. It rolls really well on wooden floors and speaks sounds, sentences that seem to be echolalic. My pup loves for us to play soccer with him and sometimes as he’s zooming, he plays with it himself. It’s a fun ball for him, but it is heavy and not made of material for him to chew.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 8 months old female German shepherd/mastiff mix loves her ball. She enjoys throwing the ball, in the air, and rolling it down the hill. The ball seems to be waterproof, as we have forgot it outside, and it was rained on for a few days.  We have chucked this ball, and it works perfectly fine. This ball helps our dog, enjoy playing by herself, to gain independence.</span>]"
https://www.chewy.com/kong-squeezz-ball-dog-toy-color/dp/38509,"KONG Squeezz Ball Dog Toy, Color Varies","[<span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our Beagle Casey loves this green ball.  I am now buying his fourth one.  He also has the blue and red one, but always chooses the green one to play with, which is why I am now buying his fourth one.  And they say dogs are color blind.  They last a long time, but you do need to toss them when they start to come apart, which is why I’m buying his fourth one.  He seeks it out above all his other toys.  He even has it near him when he sleeps.  It’s very cute.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My large male German Shepherd absolutely loves this Kong ball.  I have to keep it outside, otherwise, he constantly rolls it under the furniture in the house.  This ball has great bounce &amp; a squeaker that absolutely puts his ball drive in overdrive.  Have had this particular Kong toy a month or so &amp; he hasn't come close to destroying it, the squeaker still works!  Buying another one so my lab will have one to play with too &amp; she normally isn't interested in toys, but loves this one!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">First off, I probably should have gotten a large. The medium is smaller than a baseball. It was a good size for my puppy to catch but we have bigger balls that don’t roll under the couch as much. The squeaker is a good noise level (Kong really knows how to make squeakers that aren’t absolutely annoying). The squeaker lasted decently long as far as squeakers go. Once that broke it took a long time for the actual toy to break (maybe a month) he eventually broke the seal on one end. Luckily it only has one piece that falls out. It was thrown away then. As far as they go this one lasted my puppy toy destroyer a while. In the image you can see where the big ring is is where he eventually destroyed</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have two dogs: an Australian Cattle Dog and a Pitty and both LOVE squeaky toys but Mommy hates the 5 seconds they usually last in our house and sticking her hand down their throat to pull pieces out BUT THIS TOY SURVIVED THE WRATH OF MY DOGS. Honestly I was expecting the toy to last maybe a day, but they managed to last for around 2 weeks with the squeak intact and a month without any wholes chewed through. 

There is no such thing as an indestructible toy, but this was is extremely strong and my dogs are absolutely obsessed. My 14 year old cattle dog is now acting like a puppy and does not put this toy down. I have never seen him so happy in his life! I am going to buy a bunch more.

FAVORITE</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Ball seems durable and well-made.  4 month old puppy that is an aggressive chewer who tends to fixate on shredding on destroying toys.  Now for the downside... this ball might have, quite possibly, the most annoying squeaker of any toy we've encountered.  This ball would be best suited as a gift for a pup in your extended family and kept out of your own house.  Save yourself the headache and let the joy of this ball be spread elsewhere!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog, a 60 lb. Springer Spaniel, loved to self-play with this ball, including chewing/squeaking it. However, within 2 weeks, it stopped squeaking and the disk sections on the ends of the ball started separating from the main section.  Perhaps this ball would be good for ball tossing play, but not for self-play because of the chewing involved. My dog does well with the KONG Squeezz Dumbell.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 110lbs Rottweiler mix loves this ball (second only to the ball inside of the wubba when all the fabric is ripped off). It is probably the bounciest of any ball I have ever bought him and is every squeaky, which he loves, and is less of a high pitched squeak than other toys, which I love. He is not an aggressive chewer so I can’t speak to durability. I got the medium which is about tennis ball size.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The balls are great until your dogs learn how to chew them open. This was my second set and I won't be buying more because they didn't last more than a week. I have a lab mix, Australian Shepherd and German Shepherd and I bought all 3 sizes. The first time I only bought medium and they lasted about two months. I think the larger sizes were easier for them to pull apart.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I love this squeaky ball! The bounce is great and the size is perfect for my mini doodle. All the other squeaky balls my 20lb doodle has broken the squeaker in the ball or squished it so hard the seams pop. This one lasted about a month before he knocked it off the side of our balcony.  I’m now having to buy another one!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball is great!  It squeaks when it bounces and seems pretty tough.  I got the dark purple color (which I was hoping for!).  I will admit, my dog probably doesn't like this toy as much as I do, but he's very picky.  He may like it more as time progresses.  I'd get this ball again, though I'd probably get a smaller size.  Very nice ball!</span>]"
https://www.chewy.com/kong-squeakair-balls-packs-dog-toy/dp/44145,KONG Squeakair Balls Packs Dog Toy,"[<span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the third sized ball I have tried with my Cairn Terrier.  This one is perfect.  Tennis size too large.  The next size down was good and she played with them in retrieving.  But this mini size is just perfect.  She constantly brings one to me to throw  - yes in house- and runs to bring back.  The size allows her to breath with it in her mouth.  Absolutely recommend for a small dog - 14 lbs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Purchased the size small tennis balls for our 13 pound maltese mix, the size is perfect for her and she loves that they squeak and are easy for her to see in the grass. I love that they last for such a long time; they would probably last forever if my 60 pound aussie didn't grab them once in a while. Can't go wrong with Kong, they make the best quality products.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’ve been searching for a toy my eight month old dachshund pup can’t destroy, and these actually come pretty close. I’ve purchased other brands, and she was able to skin the covers off and shred the balls in no time. These Kong balls have held up remarkably well. She was eventually able to disable the squeakers but it took much longer than I expected. They’re still otherwise intact and fine for playing fetch, they’re just not noisy anymore. Just the right size to fit in a small dog’s mouth, too. I’ll be buying these again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Mine and my husband recently got a jack russel, and his favorite toy is a tennis ball and squeaky toys. This is by far his most favorite toy! He loves it so much! The fuzz isn’t easily torn off either, which I love. I 10/10 recommended this for any small active puppy!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Winston is addicted to squeaky balls!!! These last the best, and he always gets very excited to get new ones and take them on his walks. It is his mission and joy in life to squeak these balls, take them on walks, play fetch, then of course, destroy them. That's why we need them at a great price at Chewy!  Thanks, Chewy!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have 4 very large dogs. These balls like most I typically buy were not expected to survive long. Not only have they survived for weeks, but we have to hide them so we aren’t pestered non-stop to throw them. This is their focus rather than chewing them apart.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These balls are great, except for the fact that the squeaker breaks very quickly. This surprised me for a Kong product. Not sure if my dog is just especially gifted at breaking it, but I get about 30 mins of squeaking and then she is able to somehow break the squeaker. They are not expensive so I just keep buying more.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">For some reason these are the only toys my dog doesn’t destroy. Not sure if it’s just because balls are his favorite toys or these Kong balls are indestructible. Either way I’ve bought several of these over the years, and my dog is obsessed. One in each room, he eats with one by his side. They’re great</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got the smallest size for our golden retriever puppy (never too young to introduce tennis balls to a golden!!!).  They are durable &amp; don't come apart like most tennis balls do.  Not lots of fuzz coming off of them either.  Our adult golden has the large ones.  Definitely my favorite tennis balls for golden retrievers!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought one pack of these for my ten week chihuahua and she loved them so much, I bought two more packs so I could have them in different parts of the house.  She can play with them for hours and tries to get multiple balls in her mouth at the same time.</span>]"
https://www.chewy.com/frisco-fetch-squeaking-colorful/dp/179624,"Frisco Fetch Squeaking Colorful Tennis Ball Dog Toy, 3-Pack","[<span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These balls are among my black lab’s favorites! 
They’ve lasted longer than other balls, have a great squeak, are slightly smaller than tennis balls (so easier for her to hold in her mouth and to catch), and float (not sure if they’re “technically” for the water, but we’ve used them no problem at lakes and the ocean)!
My dog is a big chewer, but these have managed to last several months (we also try not to leave her alone with them to chew on).
These balls are great! I’m ordering more, so that I have one always ready to go (in the car, my bag, backyard, etc)!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These haven't been unleashed on the troops yet. When they are, I'll send you a notice of how - if at all - they compare to the KONG items of similar ilk. They look similar in a picture, but the real thing appears to be of much shoddier construction: we'll see.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My cat unexpectedly decided that a tennis ball was a great toy (unexpected because it was a giveaway at the vet's open house about 8 months ago and sat around the house being completely ignored for a long time). He doesn't chomp the way a dog would, so I can't testify to their durability, but Klatu enjoys chasing after them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog has always loved tennis balls, but this is his first interaction with squeaky tennis balls. He goes bananas for them. He's not a violent chewer, but he does like to gnaw on things, and these have been holding up fine. Would definitely recommend!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My malamute loves the squeaky tennis balls from Kong. So much so, we buy him a new pack about once a month. The problem is, after about 30 minutes of play, the squeaker dies and the ball becomes a foamy, wad of rubber and felt. In a mad attempt to get the ball to ""squeak"", he will keep chewing it, until it falls apart and then he shreds it. 

I tried out this Frisco brand and was pleasantly surprised! The squeaker is very durable (and even louder) than the Kong brand. When I had the toys in a pile together, he actually chose this ball every time. So not only do I approve, my dog does too! The longer that squeaker last, the longer the toy will survive.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Super tennis balls, perfect size, bounce but not too much, float in the pool - colorful so dogs can see them.  My dogs LOVE the squeaker inside but it's not crazy annoying either.  I will definitely be buying more of the Frisco balls.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 2 dogs love tennis balls. Bandit (mix black Cur and yellow lab) does tear the outer layer off, then August ( Belgium Malinios)  finishes the job.  The other 2 balls they play with as it comes in a 3 pack.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">If you can get past the LOUD high pitched squeak, these balls are great. The price is just right so that if my dog destroys one, it's not a giant loss. 
My dog loves these balls and will chase them and chew on them for a long time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">What puppy wouldn’t love a Chewy box arriving on a Sunday afternoon filled only with squeaky tennis balls????  Ahhh, my boy only had one complaint- he had to wait while mom took off the  tags and packaging. I ordered them with his prescription medication forgetting that his medicine (which he hates) would come in its own package leaving a box full of fun squeaky balls to arrive. He was a little crazy over this box and I think he would like me to do this again. I did notice a slight difference in the squeak sound compared to the same size Kong balls but my dog didn’t care. If it tasted like a tennis ball and was squeaky until chomped to its death it was all good. I found them to be a good alternative</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These balls were really nice, and seemed very well made. However, our dogs destroyed them very quickly. The felt material on the exterior ripped very easily, and the inside rubber crumbled once they bit into them.</span>]"

She'll pick them over any of her other toys, time and time again. She loves to squeak it. I only give her one at a time and give it to her when she's being supervised 100% because she loves biting the nap off. Gave 3 stars because of how easy the nap comes off. I'm purchasing the larger ones to see if that helps since she can't fit them in her mouth like with the small ones.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Don't get me wrong I'm happy with my by the balls are great but they say medium so I thought they would be bigger to me they look like they should stay small cuz I don't know how much smaller a ball can get the size of it looks like a cat toy</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs are labs and weigh in the 60's. While they have soft mouths, they destroy the balls within minutes. They absolutely love them; however I cannot justify buying them. One or two of the balls lasted a day or two of playing catch; but most stopped sqeaking way too quickly</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My one dog loves the squeaky in these balls.  Fetches them then squeaks them all the way back.  Have used two so far and one squeak has alreday crossed the rainbow bridge. My second dog does not care though so he gets the dead ones.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These balls are some of my dog’s favorites.  She enjoys fetch, but she also loves just walking around chewing on and squeaking a ball.  The squeaking gets annoying at times, but if it makes my dog happy, I’ll put up with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog loves these! They are probably his favorite toy ever. We buy them in the medium and large size for him. If it helps anyone decide which size to order, the medium is the standard size for tennis balls. The large size is close to 50% larger so definitely only good for larger dogs. Ours is a 70 lb. mutt and he likes both sizes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">They squeak, they are bright, they bounce.  What more could a puppy want?  They seem well made, only had them for a few 3 month old doodles for a few weeks, but they chase them around, and can track them easily when we throw them in the yard.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So far my babies have not destroyed these. Normally any ball that I give them is destroyed within a couple of days. I have large and small fur babies.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These are the best and fun tennis balls for our golden retriever when we play fetch. Yes they’re not as sturdy as real tennis ball but tennis balls are too tough for the jaw and bad for their teeth. Our dog absolutely loves squeaking it and rolling around the grass with it too. It brings him so much joy. And worth getting and replacing when it gets worn out.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We use these as a ""special"" toy, we live in an apartment and only play with these when we're going outside to play fetch, so she gets VERY excited when we get them out. they don't hold up well to consistent chewing but its a tennis ball, not a chew toy so that's expected. So far they haven't split down the middle as other tennis balls have done! KONG, if you're reading this, make these balls in blue or red color! We have the hardest time locating the bright yellow on green grass when it hasn't been mowed for a few days!</span>]"

(She also really likes the squeaking!) She is recovering from surgery and sedated but still somewhat playful at times and was in one of those moods. So I took this large squeaking Frisco ball out of the package and gave it to her when her last tennis ball (not a Frisco, just a promotional product) broke into several pieces, and I noticed about two minutes later that the squeaking had stopped. I looked up to see if she needed my help getting it out from under the couch, as this is a typical dance we do with any/all of her balls, and ‘</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog immediately knew this was his toy and loved playing with it. Chasing, chasing, fetching. Unfortunately by day two the outer cover started to break down and he was getting clumps of fiber and cloth off it. Stuck in his teeth, gagging. I might still buy again for a one day treat but watch closely.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My lab loves these. I have them on subscription delivery because he’s a lab and his toys don’t last long, lol. But these are durable and affordable. I think the squeaker distracts him so he doesn’t rip the hide off them. They are big enough that I don’t worry about him accidentally swallowing them</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a pit bull mix and this is her favorite toy. She has had one for over a month and it is still in one piece. That is saying a lot considering she loves to take her toys apart and she is constantly chewing on it to make is squeak. I have now bought a few more to have around in case we lose the other or for when it does eventually stop working.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is one of the best tennis balls I bought for my dogs. It's a little larger than a real tennis ball and seems to last. Usually within a day my dog haven't bitten in half.

I'm very happy</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The first time I order this small tennis ball, it was by accident.

Unfortunately, she's tough on her toys and her squeak balls only last for a couple hours.  I tried this ball because it was so much cheaper than the SqueakAir balls I usually get and these held up just as well.  Not any longer, but that's her style and not the fault of the ball.  If you're looking for a less expensive ball for squeak lovers, this fits the bill.  :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a good ball it's a little larger then a tennis ball and it has a squiker in it. My pit bull chews up, destroys everything thing that I've bought her except this ball, for what ever reason she has not tore this one up. She carries it in her mouth everywhere and sleeps with it.

Ultra Squeaker Ball Tough Dog Toy” was because of the squeaker.  However:  While the Squeaker  was nice and really loud and my dog Breeze REALLY enjoyed it I would have to say that it didn’t live up to its name.  Saying that to say that the squeaker lasted every bit of 5 minutes.  Such a disappointment so now it makes a squishy sound and defeats the purpose and Breeze pretty much ignores it.  Breeze really loves the squeaky toys but their almost always a disappointment because they only last a short time and then the thrill is over.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These are my chihuahua’s favorite balls for fetch! He’s a sucker for the squeak and the rubber is great. He doesn’t like the fuzzy tennis ball ones for some reason, and frankly neither do I since they just attract the dirt. I would love to order more but they are now over $9 for two small ones which is insane! I bought my 2 pack for under $4. Hopefully they will go down in price at some point.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog absolutely loves the Chuckit balls and we have had all the different ones offered (large, small, squeaker, glow in the dark).  The most recent squeaker balls have not held up the Chuckit reputation. One day in and the squeaker came detached.  Could have caused a serious choking issue.  Sadly disappointed in this specific ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a GSD Malinois mix who is VERY VERY chewy. He also needs squeaks to truly de-stress. This ball holds up to all he gives it -- it is his indoor chew ball which means all-day play and it is still going strong a month into owning. (We use the XL non-squeak for playing ball outside) I've ordered more in case we lose it, not because it was falling apart. Definitely worth the money!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My young greyhound is a squeaky ball destroyer, so I buy toys that claim to be rugged or indestructible. The squeaker lasted literally 9 minutes. After a several of hours of play, the surface of the ball is still intact, which is lovely, compared to most other toys I've gotten for her. The ball has a nice high bounce and she loves chasing it.
The good news is that it is easy to find inexpensive replacement squeakers on the internet. For this toy, the ones listed at 15-16mm long are the right size. Weirdly enough, the replacement squeakers often last longer than the original.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My heavy chewer has gone through so many toys! Some toys, which advertise for heavy chewers, I’ve had to take away because she destroys them almost immediately. This toy is her new favorite and I feel safe leaving her alone with the ball. She carries it with her everywhere. Great purchase!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My siborgi puppy loved his small squeaker ball and when that one got too small for him, we sized him up to the medium and he loves this one just as much! Have found that these balls are very durable and good for indoor as well as outdoor play. Definitely worth the money!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have been pleasantly surprised out how long this ball has lasted with our 2 destroyers.  They love playing with this ball around the house, and have not even tried to chew it to death.  Current issue is one has lost it squeaker, so now we fight over the one that makes noise.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a 150+ lb Neapolitan Mastiff that goes through balls in minutes.  This one is TWO weeks old already and standing the Test of Odie TIME!  still in tact!  squeaker is gone but that's ok, we have a 1 piece ball.    HE LOVES it!</span>]"

We threw it a few times at the park and then put it away. The next day I went to squeak it and it did this. Ripped at the seams. Badly designed. It no longer squeaks or bounces and is basically useless for the extra money I spent on it. My dog didn't even get to chew on it yet, we only played fetch once. Extremely disappointed and if I find out I can get a refund I will. Dont waste your time or money with this. Find another brand.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball was less than $3 and has lasted longer than any other ball we've purchased in the last two years. Absolutely worth the investment. We have a Texas Heeler who annihilates every other toy within a week. This one has lasted over two months and you can hardly tell its been used. Got both the small and large versions and am buying more to stock up in case they ever discontinue them. But I don't even see us needing to replace them anytime soon.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My greyhound loved this for exactly 25 minutes. Then the squeaker stopped working. The surface of the ball is  very tough and it bounces well.

Weirdly enough, the replacement squeakers often last longer than the original.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball is tough and bounces everywhere and it squeaks, which our dog loves.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 is that it’s advertised for small dogs, but the ball is too big for the mouth of our Yorkie mix.  I wish it had more, and deeper texture so he could get ahold of the sides.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought the medium size, which is only 2 1/2 inches. I thought this would be a perfect simple toy for my Yorky to play with and squeak. He doesn’t like a ball that won’t squeak. The thing is, the plastic/rubber is so hard, it’s impossible for him to actually squeak it. He gets excited when I squeak it with my hand, and he chases it when I roll it, but that’s the end of his interaction with it. I would not recommend this toy unless you have a bigger dog with real strong jaws.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Great Dane is almost 3 and still acts like a puppy as large as he is.  He still chews on everything.  This toy seemed strong and would last.  Auggie’s attempt is to always get out the squeaker and he was successful immediately!  The seam came open real easy for him and he got his prize.  He hasn’t chewed off the ball yet.  It still is a strong material but I will give him another couple weeks till he starts ripping the material and swallowing it.  That’s when we have to throw it away.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a Jack Russell who spends his days chasing this ball my Australian Shepherd steals it from him and chews on it makes it squeak incessantly they love it nice durable ball can’t get the squeaker out would definitely buy this again</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">He is an aggressive chewer and has had this for two months and still hasn’t punctured it. He is crazy about this ball. Ordering another in a different color because he loves it so much and gets sad if he can’t find it</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My two 80lb staffies like the blue medium ones, but they went bonkers over the orange ones. Bigger nubs for side chewing, very grippy rubber, great jaw exercise. One pulverizes toys and it’s held up quite nicely! We’ve never had one break.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a perfect chew toy, throwing ball, and squeaky toy all in one! The medium size is perfect for my pitbull because its big enough to prevent her from swallowing it and small enough to prevent her from tearing it up. She easily chewed up the x-large since it's big enough to put her paw on and really get in. I'm waiting on the large to come in stock to see what she does with that.</span>]"

They always have intriguing toys that my dog seems to love, I seem to have almost every one of there toys the original Kong has lasted years with my dog! The only toys she doesn’t like are the stuffed toys, which doesn’t surprise me she doesn’t really go for plush toys. But this ball doesn’t disappoint for only $5 it was worth every cent</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have four dogs and I try to get them they type of toy that each of them seems to prefer. Of course, they all end up carrying around each other's toys anyway but it's the thought that counts! This football is extremely popular with three of my dogs not only because when you throw it, it bounces and is crazy but because of the wild squeaker inside. The ball is thick and sturdy and has yet to even get a tear despite our one heavy chewing dog. They love to be able to give it a hard squeeze with their teeth to produce the long drawn out squeak. I have purchased this same item for past dogs that I have had and it was equally popular. Always a win with this one!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball is crazy. It’s the only ball my guy loves. He tears it up!  He plays hard with it, squeaks it letting us know he is here and happy! He chews the heck out of it making it grossly slobbery!  He tears the covering off of it when he gets bored! With all that I’d have to say this ball has held up better than most. My only complaint would be that you never knew w how long one is going to last. Sometimes the squeaker stops working, it will split at the seams after a few days. But I will continue to buy them because they make him happy. I do not buy just one when I purchase. I buy several so that my pup never has to be without one. As you can see he even sleeps with it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a boxer mix. He is a strong chewer and LOVES this football! It's small enough that he can throw it and go get it but big enough for him to be able to find it when it flies under a chair. I would say the only ""issue"" I have and it's a petty one, the squeak is ANNOYING! Lol my dog or daughter will squeak it like mad. But my doggo loves it so I'm a happy momma!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So I read everyone’s reviews and then I researched Kong toys. Well I am extremely disappointed with. My dog has destroyed the toys I bought. I bought this football because it was recommended to get the stonger toy.

Chewy and these toys are not cheap. You pay top dollar you should get good product.,</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball has the perfect pitch of obnoxious squeaking that my dogs love! (Me, not so much, but the ball isn't for me.) Lasted probably about 5 minutes, but they sure had fun destroying it! Not the durability I expected, but a fun toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Something about this ball inspires dogs to ""peel and de-fluff"" it. Within the first 5 minutes he started pulling the fluff off the ball. As you can see,  the ball is almost de-fluffed and he's still loving it. The squeaky started out very loud and obnoxious (for us, he loves ""squeak, squeak, squeaky"").  Now the squeak sounds like a dying rodent and he's still having a blast with it. I'll probably buy him a new one when this officially dies.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog shredded it under 2 hours.  I ordered 5 different Kong products.  He picked others to play with at first.  But when he started on this one he destroyed in under 2 hours.  The fuzz is too easy to be pulled off.  Once they have it loosened they break it open.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog ripped it apart immediately not tough. The ball was the skin was ripped off of the ball pretty much scalped the ball and I don't even know where the rest of it went but it's okay she rips apart everything I think she thinks it's fun well it is for her</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog likes all the Squeaker Kong balls and we normally give her the XLG size of the standard ball, but we tried this one to give her something new and it didn't last a day. She enjoyed it like she always does, but after about an hour the inner rubbery ball had split in half and was only being held together by the yellow outer material. By day two, it was in pieces. It's a shame. She really loves these balls but we can't afford to give her a new ball every other day.</span>]"

My puppy can make a dent in the popular Kong chew toy. But she hasn’t gone through one. I’m a little surprised she tore this one apart so quickly.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Fun looking toy.  Crazy loud squeak squeal.  Got the pig (character varies from order to order/random).  Was hoping for the frog but the pig was the second favorite so I'm cool with it.  Be careful removing the tag!  If you yank the tag off you can rip the toy and stuffing will come out!  Cut the tag with scissors :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I guess I’ve ordered this before. I had the duck and it is my pups favorite. Well I thought I was ordering a pig squeaky. I ended up with another duck. Not a big deal, but I was purchasing for variety so I could keep my dog interested in outdoor exercise &amp; play.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this when my Luna had her puppy teeth still. Yes I took a chance and thought it would last 2 days. Well, a couple months go by, new teeth come in and it’s still in one piece. I was impressed. Oh and the bulging eyes are a plus. Luna loves this toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this toy for my Australian Cattle dog/ German Shepard mix and she loves it.

This toy is durable for dogs that are powerful chewers and has not ripped yet.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog enjoys latex toys best so I knew this would be a hit. The only issue is the squeaker is incredibly annoying on this one. Beyond a typical annoyance with a squeaker. I have NEVER removed a toy from my dog in her life but this one had to go! My husband was willing to divorce me if not, I believe. Haha! It was so bad. We wouldn't recommend this unless your dog spends 99% of her time outside in complete isolation in the middle of nowhere with no souls within a 5 mile radius. I am giving it a 3 star rating because joy-wise, it was a good one for my pet. And she didn't destroy it on day 1 which is a miracle in itself.

There are no punctures or tears showing on the ball, but the squeakie died after a particularly enthusiastic squeaking session. I can barely squish this ball with my hand, so it's pretty strong; I don't know if the squeakie got mooshed just the right way to stop it from working or what, since I see no damage on the outside. Oh well. Back to the drawing board for Rottie-proof squeaky toys. Sigh.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was a fun toy for a couple of minutes. I thought with it being larger it would be more durable. But our bully breed foster chewed it apart in less than 30 minutes.  I don't necessarily blame the ball as much as I blame our dog.  For fetch this is probably fine, but any chewer, pass.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I can't understand how these have such good reviews.  We bought many packs of these because our dog loves playing with them, but the squeak stops after 15 to 20 minutes of play.  The plus is that they work with the chuckit's and that's about it.  

Our dog will squeak the ball a couple of times when he's running it back to me and then drops it, so it's not like he being overly aggressive with the biting and still they stop working.  We actually had 1 recently that made it to the second day of play (only 15-20 mins session) but stopped working after the first or second throw.

The only reason I don't give this a 5 is because the squeaker give out rather quickly.

It has a good bounce, even when it is partially disassembled. Not as good as a competitor brand, but a solid second place.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 3yr old German Shepherd is a chewer and this is the only thing we have found that so far he cannot chew into pieces (he even managed to chew pieces off the kind extreme).

It wasn’t completely broken, so we shoved a chuckit breathe right ball inside to keep her occupied and she was easily able to break chunks off of this ball and tear it apart. We had to take it away and throw it in the garbage so she didn’t eat any little pieces. Might be good if you have a very gentle dog, but it won’t stand up to tug or any rough play with a 75lb GSD. I won’t order again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered this because my puppy loves to chew on things and chews through everything that I get him that is made up of some sort of fabric. I had gotten him a tiny one when I first got him but I have been afraid lately that he would swallow the tiny one. And it’s the only toy he has that he has not destroyed. Thinking that the medium with the next size I ordered it and it’s so large and heavy, It’s bigger than his head and too much for him to carry he doesn’t like it. So it’s disappointing. Not the toys fault, it’s my fault that I wasted the money because he can’t play with it Because it’s too heavy for him to pick up. He’s a king Charles spaniel</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 3 1/2-month-old Catahoula Leopard Dog/Border Collie mix puppy who needs lots of play, especially due to his mix of breeds. Being a puppy, he wants to chew on everything and his mix makes him a strong chewer, even at his age. He also loves to play fetch (well, his version of it) and tug-of-war. I got this in a large as I didn't want to have to constantly rescue it from under the couch or other furniture. I've had this for 1 1/2 months and so far it has stood up wonderfully to his chewing on it and can withstand our vigorous games of tug-of-war (for ""drop-it"" training). It still looks like new. It's great for indoor play since it is flexible: I can toss it across the room, against a wall</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So I bought 2 of these I have 2 pitbull and a Argentina dogo both are already dead they have only had them 2 days.  Sadly it's my dogo fav. Toy she carries the pieces around.  I wish it was more heavy duty to withstand my power chewers.  They destroy every toy they come in contact with lol . I have 3 stars cause it's her fav. Toy.  But I would hope they can make them more sturdy . They rip easy . Ima be ordering more this time hopefully have more then 2 they will last a little longer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought 2 of these balls after seeing a Pinterest project. The ball was stuffed with ribbons/strips of fabric for the dogs to pull out. It worked great for my dog that pulls tags off of everything. It is a good quality product. It's made of soft pliable rubber so when tossed it doesn't damage anything it may hit. Well worth the money. I am considering buying the smaller sizes as well.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I had this recommended by a family member. Their dogs always have one and love it. They have destroyed a couple by normal wear but they love them. My puppy had wear cracks in the rubber an hour into having the toy and then had a huge hole a little bit later. So I would recommend as a fantastic toy if you don’t have a toy destroyer on your hands like me</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Maltese Poodle mix loved how it bounced but once I put a treat in it she had this ripped open in less than 15 minutes! Unfortunately I cannot recommend this unless your dog isn’t a chewer or smart enough to figure out how to pull with her paws and bite/chew at the same time to get the treats out.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Puppies seem to like big toys and this one is big but lightweight (Ihave the medium size). Perfect for introducing my little fosters to fetch but the design also lends itself to tug. I curl one finger thru it and the pup will tug and tug. Toss it in the kiddie pool and they clamber in and pull it out.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 95 lb lab loves his ball. He is not an agressive chewer, so I can't attest to the longevity for a heavy chewer. Griffin likes to shake and chase it and roll around on it. This is actually my second ball since the first one was finally breaking apart after about 5 years of abuse.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my dog’s favorite toy. The ball is durable for a 70 lb standard poodle who wants to play ball 24/7 and even naps with his balls. It can easily be carried and caught in his mouth. In fact, my dog will carry two of them in his mouth at a time.  It is easy to grasp and throw for a game of fetch, even with dog slobber. This was a replacement for one of his balls that has finally broken after 2 1/2 years because of playing tug-of-war with it, but he still plays with the broken one.</span>]"

Major rope burn happens when you try to pull. The knot on the end isn't big enough to be a good grip.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a really cool dog toy!  It also makes it easier for me to retrieve the ball to throw it again since there is a rope.  My dog enjoys the rope as well as the ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The rope is nylon and shredded in minutes. Thin and cheap and not made to last. The ball is fine, but I didn't buy just a ball, did I? Very disappointing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Throat came untied within 10 minutes and due to the type of rope it is not easily inserted back inside the ball. I would not recommend this and I would not buy it again</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy last less than an hour out of the box.

She’s slowly showing more interest. My only concern is that since it is so hard, she may break a tooth as she alternates between nosing, pawing and trying to bite it. But knowing she is interested in it, we’ll probably splurge for a jolly ball at a later time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought the 14"" one and it is huge!  Our Rottweiller destroys anything soft or chewy.  We have purchased a few Jolly balls and he destroys them after one day!  He loves this ball - he chases it around and kicks it all around the yard.  I think the fact he can't bite into it is the best part. It is hard and I don't recommend for indoor use - but it is worth it for indestructibility.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">There are two versions of this ball. One is nearly twice as heavy as the other. The lighter, better (safer and faster in play) version we bought from Chewy. Dobby is ADDICTED to rolling this ball! We have a great time playing as partners! He will wait by the door of any room in which it's being stored to tell me he wants to play ""small-ball."" And I have to force him to take breaks during play because it's such a fast, vigorous, exhausting game. When I begin to reach for the ball, he literally grabs it from me with his paws, or rolls it away as fast as he can go. But if I ask him to take a rest, he immediately lies down and ""holds"" the ball until he's rested enough to begin play again.

While this ball is a hard ball, (not a chew toy at all), it is awesome for the back yard. She noses it around all over the backyard just as fast as she can. We try to let her play with it nightly, as it wears her comply out and she sleeps all night! If you had carpet, you could probably tolerate inside play, but i think on hard floors it would be too loud. I plan to order her a smaller one for play at the office. Only bad side is it looks like the red ""rubber ball"" we all had growing up-DON""T think you are gonna run by and give it a swift kick lol. it's heavy and hard, but does EXACTLY what we wanted it to do.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a dog daycare. This product just arrived and none of the dogs will play with it. I have one boxer dog that puts her paw on it, but that's it. I was hoping they would nose it around. I will update this if I see dogs take interest. otherwise, try the teaser ball or the ball like this with the rope on each side. the dogs are loving those.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">If you have a herding dog YOU NEED THIS! My blue heeler constantly wants to play fetch and was never interested in playing with any other toys or even my other dogs to entertain himself, which I don’t mind playing fetch 100 times a day most of the time, but a girl is lazy some days! So I had very low hopes for this, but he took to it immediately and is obsessed!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered two for our large breed 4 month old pups.

Yes, these balls are indestructible but, my dogs haven't even attempted to play with them.  When I first introduced them to our yard our puppies barked at them like they were an intruder.  Once the danger was alleviated they've gone completely ignored.  I try to roll them to our dogs. . . nothing.  I try to engage our dogs with them. . . nothing.  They are large and hard plastic and I can't see why a dog would be interested in them either.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">we have three dogs. one of them being a smart mix breed.

THANK YOU!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I loved seeing how other dogs love this ball so I ordered two- one for each of my dogs.

The squeaker lasted a little more than half an hour. For this doggie, that's a long time! The good news is that it is easy to find inexpensive replacement squeakers on the internet. For this toy, the ones listed at 15-16mm long are the right size. Weirdly enough, the replacement squeakers often last longer than the original.
After a several of hours of play, the surface of the ball is still intact, which is lovely, compared to most other toys I've gotten for her. The ball has a nice high bounce and she loves chasing it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have several super-chewer dogs. I ordered two large and one medium of these gnawsome squeaker balls. I was positive they’d be destroyed within hours. It’s now been eight days and all the toys are in perfect shape. I’m not saying your dog won’t destroy these, but my Malinois and hound dog, who both notoriously shred every toy they are given, are still happily playing. The plastic is more durable than I expected and they have good bounce. My pups love to squeak these dang things so much I barely get a break, which isn’t awesome while holed up at home... and all my friends now ask if I have a bird when we talk over the phone. But indoor fetch is more exciting than ever and it makes me happy to</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Purchased this item not sure if it would be too small for my great dane, but it was Perfect! The squeak really keeps her entertained and she will even play by herself sometimes . She enjoys it and looks forward to ""playtime"". Durable quality, bought 2 and both are still in tact. First one lost a little ""bounce"" but second one is still going strong.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">As mentioned in other reviews, Spikes do reduce the speed with which Puppy destroys the toy, as she seems to enjoy the feeling of nubs.  Once she got a hole in it, she then made progress in disassembly each time she had it. We use it for her to chase (She’s not a retriever!) and remove it soon after.  If she were allowed to chew at will, it would be destroyed in a short time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Boston Terrier is possessed when it comes to playing with this ball. It is the perfect size for her and with the squeaker in it, she goes crazy when catching it. The rubber spikes all over the exterior of the ball also massage her mouth when catching and chewing on it. I bought two of them and will have to get more as she will go through them as much and often as she plays with them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These balls are my yorkie / terrier mix's favorite!  She recently destroyed her last one and I have looked every-where and bought a dozen others over the last few months.  She refused to play with any of them and just looked at me with such a pitiful look that none of them was her ""squeaky ball"".  Not having the actual manufacturer and only pieces of the old one from which to estimate the size, I took a chance on these.  She was skeptical at first, but once she played with it a little and we played catch a time or two, she realized that indeed ""Squeaky Ball"" is BACK!!  Thank you, Thank you!

She lost her first one but our local pet store didn’t have a large Chuck It Ultra so I tried tennis balls but those got destroyed within a day, and other rubber balls just didn’t make her as happy as her Chuck It did! Thankfully Chewy had a really good deal on Large Chuck It balls so I FINALLY got one. My dog was ECSTATIC! She would play and play and play until she is desperate for water! I am not sure if it’s the orange color or the fact that it’s hollow and she can squeeze it but it’s her absolute favorite. Thank you Chuck It and thank you Chewy for making my dog happy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a GSD-Malinois mix who is VERY VERY chewy. HE LOVES the XL Ultra and I love that a month later it hasn't fallen apart! No matter how he bites it, it shows no signs of wear. My only complaint is that it gets VERY slippery with slobber when we are playing ball so I have to keep a bandana onhand! Bounces really well on (hard) grass and other surfaces and the orange color means we find it in the weeds. I've ordered more in case we lose it, not because it was falling apart. Definitely worth the money!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I just got my first pit bull (3yo) about a month ago. She had a regular sized Chuckit! ball when she moved in, but my Boston Terrier kept stealing it so I thought I'd get some bigger ones. I also decided to get some other toys to keep the PB from getting bored.

I shouldn't have bothered.

This dog has chewed through 4 rope toys, and 2 stuffed toys. She's demolished one of those tire toys. I'm afraid to get her a Kong because I might just cry when she rips it to shreds in 4 hours.

The Chuckit! balls, on the other hand, have survived. She lays on the floor and chews them like they were gum, but they just bounce right back! She hasn't managed to destroy a single one of the three!

When</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have 7 golden retrievers.  Chuck it rubber type balls are the only balls they will use.  It’s to bad that the Chuckit throwers don’t come with these higher end balls.  My dogs won’t touch the orange and blue tennis type balls that come with the Chuckit throwers.  They run after the tennis type balls but when they get to them they sniff them and just walk away- I have  to retrieve them.  So, now the tennis material balls go straight to the trash.  Such a waste of resources.  For the price, Chuckit should provide these higher in balls that last longer, are much less apt to be  destroyed and swallowed in pieces and are more sanitary.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Chuckit makes the best fetch balls. My GSD loves squeaky ones, but she likes this one too. They bounce better than tennis balls and are much much more durable. They last a long time. Definitely worth the cost. They’re easy to rinse off and clean up, unlike tennis balls. My dog likes to drop her balls in her water bowl when we take a break and these don’t need to be dried out for days like tennis balls.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this product because all the comments said how strong the toy is and how long it lasted. Unfortunately, my two year old Am Staff was able to destroy it in LESS than a WEEK! If you have a dog with a strong jaw and loves to chew this product might not be ideal if your looking for a toy to last longer than a week   Pretty disappointed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Got this for a friend’s Rottie-Shepherd mix, and it’s still intact after two weeks’ free access. He’s not a typical power-chewer: rather, his favorite hobby is figuring out how to take things apart. He finds a toy’s weak spot with shepherd’s determination, focus, and sheer bliss for creative problem solving; and then applies the full bite strength of his likely breed mix to systematically and joyously dismantle it like a kid with a Christmas box. His house is littered with tiny fragments of top-brand tough toys - hard rubber reduced to confetti, hard plastic puzzle toys confiscated when the plastic began cracking, scraps of reinforced seams, with the alleged puncture-proof kevlar and stuffing</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves these balls and this is a nice size so I don’t have to worry about her accidentally swallowing it. We kick it off the porch and it goes sailing across the yard and she loves to chase after it that way. She has popped  the smaller size so we went to this bigger one and it seems to be holding up fine for now.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’ve got 3 heelers all in different sizes. I got the x-large chuckit ball because the medium ones always roll under the couch and this one doesn’t!

Now I need to buy more since the fur kids don’t know how to share lol.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My German Shepherd’s and Belgian melon law love love love these balls! They of course have crazy #BAL Drive and these check it balls can with stand there chewing and last forever!

This probably would not be the best ball for a strong or power chewer. Our only disappointment is the squeaker broke within the first few days of her playing with it. It is a very affordable toy and worth the small cost to replace it because our pup loves it so much. She likes all her toys but I honestly think this is her favorite. I would recommend and have recommended this ball. I have given this ball to my mother and brother who both have 30lb Australian Shepherds. Both of the Australian Shepherds love</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Yuba LOVES this darn thing. She actually ""found"" this ball 2x before I figured out what it was and ordered it. First, she found one at a lake and would not let it go - sadly we learned it belonged to another dog. When she ""found"" it again at another lake, she took off to play independently with it and would not let me near her to take it away!  The other hoomans did not seem impressed. I went home that day and ordered 2! I remove it after a certain amount of play because the squeaking does get a little annoying... I would also agree with other reviews that the packaging is not great - poorly designed with tiny plastic pieces pierced through the ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Chinese Crested of 19lbs, absolutely loves these squeaky balls. He has small, medium and large. For some reason he loves the large one best, but plays with them all. Funny thing is that the large one has the highest pitch squeal when you squeeze it, and the other two are more normal. The large one sounds like a large bird and even though he has tiny teeth, it takes him longer to pick up the large one and he doesn’t care if it just takes him a few more seconds then picking up the others and he is happy as can be throwing it into the air, chasing it, or just sleeping with them. One of the best toys, for sure.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I make sure I have these balls with me in the house, car, and my pocket when walking. The three I keep in my car are for when we go to a park.  The small balls fit in the ""ChuckIt"" stick for tennis balls.  The one in my pocket is to get my dogs attention when another dog approaches.  The ball squeaks and he responds every time.  I definitely have to have at least three for inside.  I bought some medium and large ones for my friends large golden retriever.  He hoards them and loves them.  My little dog can also pick up the medium balls.  I highly recommend these gems.  I wouldn't want to be without them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our Australian Cattle Dog was obsessed with one specific ball that kept being chewed further down by a family dog until it became a shallow bowl- we couldn't find a replacement that he loved as much and he would just want us to throw this sad little sliver what once was a ball... until now!!! 

HE LOVES THIS BALL.... SO MUCH. We immediately bought extra so we'll have back ups. 

He's not an aggressive chewer so they're holding up super well. We just have to keep them out of reach of that one family dog with little dagger teeth (haha) that can destroy them in a matter of minutes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have 110 lb. Bernese Mtn Dog, and this is by far his favorite toy!   It's a big substitute also for chewing on things you don't want chewed.   We play with it in the house and outside.  It has a nice bounce so when I can get it away from him we play fetch and he can catch it on the bounce!   I order one a month because after a few weeks of chewing , water and slobber it deflates a bit and  little foam pieces come out.  I've tried other firmer squeaky balls the same size but none catches his attention over this one!    And so easy with Chewy to come with his auto ship.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Goldie (Akita mix) has plenty of balls but the Hartz Dura Play balls in all sizes are her absolute favorite! It may be because they are bacon scented. They are tough and she loves their squeak and the way they bounce. After dinner, we have to ""play ball""  and she never gets tired of them. She was a rescued mother dog and it is heart warming to see her have so much fun playing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">One of my dogs is very mellow and shy.  But once you take this ball out she goes NUTS! It is the only toy we can get her to go crazy about and she will play fetch with it all day.  It is strictly and outside toy in our household because she squeaks it so much!  I highly recommend this toy to anyone!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Not sure why this ball is so better than all others. But my ball obsessed doodle loves it. It is a mess to clean up if he gets to the foam so the second I see a hole it goes in the trash and I order 5 more. When I’m tired I have to hide it. The other reviews are right the squeaker is loud and annoying but it only lasts a few days.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We got our 7-week old lab puppy last week and she absolutely adored this ball! She could only really roll it around and jump on it but now it fits in her mouth. She likes how it smells like bacon and squeaks. She is literally the toughest chewer I've ever met for a pup her age. We tried out the Kong rope toys and within 2 days the squeaker and rope were pulled out and the squirrels head was pulled off.

They are going CRAZY over them! Wouldn't have picked them based on appearance (I mean, what are these lil critters supposed to be anyways?) But the reviews were good and I now see why. 
Time will tell how these hold up to persistent chewing, but you can't beat the price for hours of enjoyment right out of the box. I now almost wish the squeaker didn't work so well, haha! 
Absolutely will buy again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The dog toy lost its squeaker fairly early in the game, but Tallullah the Chespeake Bay retreiver loves it anyway.

Im so glad I got it, and it was an amazing price too! She loves it so much and the texture of it seems to be good for her since she is teething. Ozzie also loves it and it has held up well through chewing so far.</span>]"

She would spend the entire day fetching tennis balls if we would let her. We got her this pack of tennis balls as part of her birthday presents. It was, by far, the most exciting part of the day for her. She was so excited, she didn't know where to start! I would recommend for anyone else who has a tennis ball fiend like ours.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">When playing fetch, my dog is in the habit of chewing the ball while returning it to me. These balls fall apart quickly and are only good for a session or two of fetch. My dog is not a particularly strong chewer. These balls do not hold up to light to moderate chewing.

They also have a very strong and unpleasant odor.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I like that it came with a lot but my dog went through them pet quicky. They lasted a while just because there was so many of them. I would rather pay 15-20 dollars for one tennis ball if I knew my dog couldn't break it or dent it</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Overall as a tennis ball they are great but I am not sure about the ""pressure-less"" claim. I had bought these for my power chewer Vizsla and he has figured out how to split them in half with the felt still on in about a half hour. (haven't actually timed it but it feels that long). I was looking for a solution to the problem but these are not it, luckily its a bag of 18 so it should last a little while but not as long as it should. The reason why I am rating them high is I am sure they would be fine for any other dog just not mine.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Purchased these for our 1 yo lab to throw in the lake and her to retrieved ,as our original tennis balls got old.  These Didn’t last , and all she did was fetch and bring back   Suggest not for large dogs</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog removed the green fuzzy skin. Or he dismantled the ball easily from the seams. If they were real tennis balls they wouldn’t be destroyed on this way.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These are bouncy and bright and I’m so glad we ordered these instead of waiting for our neighbor to give us back the ones that have accidentally ended up In his yard. lol.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves the balls and she goes through a lot of them - the balls last, but we live on Lake Michigan and walk in the woods.  She plays with them in the sand and dirt and water and they get filthy and easily lost as she drops them to go investigate a new smell.  I just wish they could stay neon yellow so we could find them!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These balls are horrible! They split apart and lose their bounce almost immediately. Don’t waste your money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The balls had a very strong and potent smell even when out of the bag for a few days. I wouldn’t recommend these, never had a problem with our Chuck It’s and will stick with them for now on</span>]"

When we adopted Cooper in 2018, My husband took him for a ride and got him his favorite green ball. He has other balls but nothing compares to his green ball. Yesterday after 2 years of daily play he bit it a little to hard and then started to dismantle it. I found the ball on Chewy but could not pick the color. I called and they found him a green ball. We should have it tomorrow. 

Well we didn’t get a green ball we revived a red one. I called and they said they couldn’t insure a green one but would try again. We received a blue ball. Cooper has settled on the blue for now. The green one is now in two pieces and still being played with. Chewy really tried for us.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My GSD loves this ball! I have purchased several! It’s nice, very bouncy and it doesn’t hurt her mouth when she catches it (she likes to jump and catch it on the bounce!). Easy for me to handle and lightweight. But if you are looking for something to play with at night...the light (and squeaker) doesn’t last but maybe a couple days. After that, the mechanism for those just tumble around inside the ball. If they lasted longer, I would give this a higher rating.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Dobe absolutely loves these Squeak and Light balls. I buy these ALL the time. It’s really the only toy he plays with. I was so disappointed this time because 2 of them would not flash. He actually looked at me and dropped it and wouldn’t play with it. I couldn’t believe it. I had to to get one that actually would flash and squeak. I think Chewy needs to check battery life on these. Very disappointing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Why does my baby loves this ball rather than the many others I previously got him...size?...the blinking?...no smooth surface makes it easier to catch?...NO IDEA...but he goes everywhere with it...and shares it with his sister while playing ....i order a few more...very durable..been one week and ball still intact!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Like, VERY loud.  Wednesday is deaf, so that part doesn't do her any good.  However, it lights up!  She is also vision-impaired and has difficulty seeing certain colors, especially when there is a lot of furniture/stuff in the room or her other toys are scattered about. The flashing lights grab her attention every time, and the ball usually stays lit long enough for her to get to it.  Just beware, the squeaker is super loud.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered 4 of these light up balls,they also squeak. 
Two light up , two didn't. Chewy replaced the ones and one of those don't work. I really,really wish Chewy could check things like this it is so frustrating to have to have them replaced even though Chewy replaced them immediately.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our husky/malamute LOVES this ball, the light up feature keeps him chasing it and rolling around with it constantly, the squeak is very loud and he make sure you know it! Very durable for aggressive chewers, I never worry that he can chew this up, I do always supervise when he plays with the toy. Highly recomend!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Let me start by saying I’ve bought similar toys from Chewy in the past and been pleased.  This particular toy, however, did not light up very well and the light mechanism only lasted for about two weeks.  Such a disappointment for me and my dog who really enjoys the light-up toys.  Now it is just another squeaky ball.  When I buy again, I will look for a different brand.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The lights last a decent amount of time. It’s neat to watch the ball bounce through the yard at night.
While this toy can be quickly chewed up, our pit bull treats it as his security blanket. He plays fetch as much as possible with this ball, cleans it, and sleeps with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the BEST ball we've found for our 5 month old Mini Goldendoodle! She is ball nutz anyway but this one lights up and squeaks and has the best grip for her little puppy mouth. I  have 4 of them and plan on getting more. Nothing more fun than a ball-a-palooza in a dark room with these fun balls!</span>]"

Max Glow Ball Dog Toy,"[<span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I sometimes don't get home until after dark and was looking for a glow toy that I could use to play with my dog outside when I got home. This is wonderful! It doesn't take long (just a few minutes) to get to glowing and it lasts a long time. The longer you ""charge"" it in the light, the longer the glow time. My dog has no problem finding the ball and tracking it when I throw it now. I only keep it as an outside toy and take it away from her when we're done, but even though she has chewed on it some, it still is in great shape, like new. It also rinses off very easily after all the dog slobber and dirt. I will definitely buy it again if she ever ruins this one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a ball obsessed Labrador retriever who requires daily exercise. These glow in the dark balls are just the ticket! They are not quite as thick and heavy as the original Chuckit! balls but these feature a slight whistle when flying through the air and they seem to be just as indestructible. The best part is that when he is running back to me in the dark, after the retrieve all I can see is a floating ball coming at me! With the shorter days coming in the winter months, we will be able to continue our daily play time!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Remember the days of “must see tv”? That’s what this glow ball is for our standard golden doodle. Every night after supper she asks to go outside with it no matter what. During daytime she loves treats inside for good chewing in her crate. I’d say it’s a top 5 toy for her, maybe even top 3. She’s a power chewer and these have lasted more than 6 months.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I love that I can find them in the dark or throw them in the dark. My dog loves the texture the sound they make. She is a very aggressive chewer. They give when she chews and usually last at least a month or more making them economical for me too. She is a Corgi Beagle mix and has a high prey drive. She likes the regular orange and blue Chuckit balls too and Kong toys. The Chuckit last the longest with her.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog can’t get enough! He absolutely loves these balls. He even falls asleep with them. He loves how the ball makes a whistle sound when it’s thrown and I love that they glow in the dark so I can find it! The best part is that he can’t destroy the ball and trust me he has tried.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have been purchasing these for my Doberman for years now. They are so durable. He chews on them all day and they don't break. They are great for playing fetch because he can hear the whistle. Hands down. The best ball for dogs!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This works very well in the dark I got the large since I have German shepherds. They look so funny when they run back all you can see is the glow ball. They are softer than the regular balls so once we done playing I don't let them chew on them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I tend to play with my dog a lot at night down here in Texas. It’s just too hot to be outside in daylight. Didn’t have very high expectations for this ball but WOW! It is amazing! Stays lit the entire time I’m outside - upwards of an hour. I put it up right next to a light before going out and that makes it extra bright. Very easy for my dog to see the light and for me to find it if it’s too dark outside. Highly recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We lost the ball that came with the launcher and we are happy to have a new one to replace it. It's a good quality ball and the holes make it go farther when thrown or especially launched.The glow in the dark feature is great!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My high energy Mal just loves these balls! It is the only thing she does not destroy! I love the fact that at night when she pushes them under the couch they glow! LOL! I highly recommend them for your ball enthusiasts!</span>]"

He is OBVIOUSLY a ferocious beast tipping the scales at 9.5 lbs with a muzzle of a whopping 2 inches in length. Such a beast!

So far, knock on wood, it has held up to their chewing and tug of war which is saying a lot!! They are not little dogs, Bernese Mountain dogs, each a little over 100 lbs so when I say it’s been durable that’s huge! Might have to get another one since they enjoy it so much.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loved it coming out of the Chewy box and plays w/ it when I instigated, but he doesn't go for this toy of his own. Just not his thing right now. It seems well made &amp; squeak section of the toy is very loud and easy for him to bite into. The covering keeps it protected but an aggressive chewer could get through it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was most excited about this wubba! Couldn't wait to get it.

This didn’t last 5 minutes before he started to destroy it. I loved the idea of this because most tough chewers toys have treats, and I was looking for something he would enjoy without food, but this didn’t hold up. As soon as he had access to the tennis ball that started to get torn apart too. Would not recommend for tougher chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was a bit miffed when it took my 14 month old boxer boy less than 5 minutes to get the smaller ball out. I have since changed my mind and I’ve decided this is one of my favorite toys. Even without the interior ball he won’t stop playing with it because it’s got an addictive squeak that he can’t get enough of. He takes quick breaks to go potty and hang out with his big sis a bit then goes right back to playing with it. The sound is driving my husband crazy but I am loving it because this dog is so hard to tire out and he won’t stop playing with this toy. He’ll sleep well tonight!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I'd give this toy zero stars if I could. The KONG brand is usually pretty durable. In a matter of half an hour, our boy had the tennis ball out, and chewed most of the outer layer off.  Threw out the ball, and let him play with the plastic part. Within a half an hour, he chewed a hole in the edge of that. So, after an hour of play, the toy went in the trash. I would not recommend this toy for aggressive chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this for my pit mix who destroys anything that isn't a Chuck It ball. Bought this for him as something to work at while he was resting from a torn ACL. He destroyed the tennis ball within minutes (which was expected), but the rubber squeaky thing has stayed in tact and he LOVES to squeak it with his nose and paws all over the house now.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered this toy for my two large dogs. I also ordered it because it was Kong brand, and I thought it would be good due to the brand (never had issues before).

Would not recommended.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">FedEx delivered this 2 hours ago, and it is already torn apart. Not durable at all. But have to say the doggie loves it. Do not buy if you have a tough chewer. It won’t last.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have an APBT. She can destroy any toy. As suspected, the tennis ball inside this toy was pulled out and shredded within hours; however, the squeaking of the remaining part of the toy kept her entertained for weeks! Eventually, the entire toy was ripped into pieces, but she had one heck of a good time while it lasted.

I have been ordering these every 2-3 months since he was 6 months old. He is a tough chewer so by the time I’m ordering a new one its destroyed like other photos posted, but I dont think thats a flaw of the toy! He loves to sit down with it and rip on it, and toys aren’t meant to last forever, so I let him. Even once its ripped we still play with it for a few more weeks, it doesn’t kick as well but is still fun to throw! Such a fun toy for him and for me and my family as we were all soccer players. I can’t recommend this toy enough!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Best ball so far. Kick it, throw it, grip it and make your dog jump. Easy for the dog to grip, lasted the longest. A husky mix, black mouth cur and a heeler play with this ball. The husky mix and black mouth cur carry it together. It won't last forever but its worth it for me.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves this ball, she carries it around with her everywhere. She chews on it all the time and she can’t seem to ruin it like all other large balls we have gotten her.

He loves this thing and our vet recommended retrieving something bigger over smaller as its easier on their joints. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the recommendations say for large dogs but the even bigger size would've been better.

We have 3 GSDs ranging from 2-4 years old all brothers and these are hands down their favorite toys!! With 3 German Shepards these might not last as long as other balls, the Jolly dog rubber ones are also high on our list (little more durable) but in all honesty they both have about the same life expectancy with 3 GSDs even when we try and keep them from playing tug of war with them. With that said it is a small price to pay for a toy that they absolutely love!!! Highly recommend but if you have more than 1 dog buy a couple and don't be mad when they tear them apart after about a month or so.... Still cheaper than replacing shoes or other non dog toy items</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this for my 9 month old lab because she loves chasing a soccer ball.

But our Border Collie, Kelpie, Smithfield, immigrant from Australia, has to chew the ball in-between throws. It lasted 5 minutes before he punctured the first ball.

No punctures and he's adapted well to the different texture.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">my golden retriever loves chuck it tennis balls she’s kind of old and doesn’t like to exercise but these got her in the mood to play!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I am a daschund terrier mix about 19 lbs. this is bigger than a standard tennis ball. Although it was fun, I ate part of the fuzz cover and the ball was a bit too big for even my big mouth</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pit bull destroyed this ball in less than three minutes. Her teeth went right through it. I would not recommend for heavy chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I personally don't have a chuck it thrower so I can't rate them on that aspect. But, they were cheaper than tennis balls so I got them. Overall really impressed especially with the size (large) they were just the right size not to big not to small for a 10 month old vizsla. They have survived my little tennis ball monster and thats a high compliment!! Highly recommend!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Seems these are glued together in the middle, after my dog compressed them a bit they came apart right away</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These balls did not stand up well. My dog doesn’t have the opportunity to just chew on them. We play fetch: I toss it and he brings it back. We play with 2 at a time - I throw one he brings it back and I throw the other. Both of them have split. They also don’t bounce. Tennis balls work much better. I wouldn’t get these again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These are terrible. My dog chewed off the fuzz the first time playing with it. Now her poop is full of orange fuzz. Regular tennis balls are more durable than these.</span>]"

Within minutes, my dog had the top seam ripped open and in less than an hour had completely exposed the small tennis ball and bitten a chunk out of it. I removed the ball and tied off the top with one of the seam threads. This seems to have slowed the destruction of the rest of the toy. (A month ago I ordered a Wubba Ballistic Friends toy that met a similar fate.) But my dog LOVES these toys! The legs seem to withstand his harsh treatment. Wubba should make an ""octopus"" that has the squeaky ball in the middle with legs on each end. Something that is still throwable, but will stand up to power pups like mine.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was fun to toss and bring back. Also strips are made out of a fabric that is supposed to not go stringy if chewed on which can cause havoc and even death if those strings get in the intestines of dogs. Middle ball is a squeaker, small ball is kong sturdy. But one caution! If left alone and left unsupervised some dogs will still be able to chew this fabric and it does string up! So only give to play with under supervision. I found this out second day as my dog chewed the fabric off the small ball part so I put it up. So now he only gets to play with it if I can watch him with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The small is still big enough for a medium to medium large dog.  My pibble is a HUGE fan.  I had bought it for my Yorkie though and it's just too big for her but she keeps dragging the tails end to drag it back to me.  She can't carry it, but it's a good length and size for my pibble mix.

I wish sizes of toys were a little more clear...if I search for ""extra small or toy breed toys"" I want to find toys that would work for that size of dog.  I do like the toy though - size and price was good for a solid toy.  Kong toys are very well made and last nearly forever.

My only issue it that I thought I was getting something for a toy breed dog, but it's really much too big for her.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Using this with a German Shepard/Lab mix and he loves it. He loves grabbing it by the tassels and doing the death shake. So far he hasn’t thrown it. (Thank goodness) I’ve read some of these reviews where it has been destroyed, and believe it depends on the dog. My Boxador, Duncan would have demolished this, he loved picking cloth toys apart. Teddy is a fetch/pursuit, tug-o-war, make it squeal fan, so this is perfect for him. 3 months and still going strong. Because he’s very active with this toy I couldn’t get a shot of him using it. That would have been reckless on my part.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have bought 2 of these in less that 3 weeks. My 10 month old beagle destroyed the squeaker inside the first one in 6 days. The second one made it 9 days. I was hoping for a tough enough toy that my pup couldn't destroy so quickly. We can still play tug of war and fetch with it, but he loses interest pretty quickly since he constantly tries to squeak it and nothing happens.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">i had to return this toy as within days the squeaker broke (and no fun for my dog without a squeaker!)  she is not rough on her toys and she played with it a bit - but not very much - certainly not enough for the squeaker to stop squeaking.
i have another one that has done great with lots of play - and my dog really likes the toy - so i'm thinking this one was an outlier!  chewy was great and refunded my money without question.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I usually like Kong toys but do not purchase this item for a strong chewer or a dog that likes to Play rough.  This would make a great fetch toy if it is taken away when the game is over, or if it is purchased for a smaller dog. For mine, the squeaker top was popped within 4 minutes of arriving and the top ball was chewed out and in peices by the evening. The next day it looked like a string headed octopus :(   It is really frustrating spend a lot of money on toys that don't last more than a day.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We got our first kong wubba today, Luna is in love. It was the first thing she wanted out of the box. It can do all her favorite things, fetch, tug, and squeak! It seems durable; she can be pretty destructive so we will see how long it lasts. For now she is thoroughly pleased.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Going to order again. Maybe poor or defective Kong toy. In 1 day rhe top of one toy was chewed open and exposed the tennis ball. Another kong toy was shredded on the tassel part. I have purchased these before and they have worked great.

Her lower jaw was stuck in there and she was pulling so hard to get it unstuck that it looked like her jaw would break. I couldn’t have that happening so we cut the toy into two toys. We cut the ring off the ball. Problem solved and now we have two toys. Please be warned this can happen and endanger your dogs jaw and be ready to edit the toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This fun toy is made of soft enough material that I never gave it to my 100# land shark.  (Her chompers cut like scissors.)  Instead we played tug, and the rim held up for about 15 minutes before breaking apart.  Since there are multiple hand grips, it got through  multiple play sessions.  Wish there were some cable or reinforcement inside the rim to extend its longevity.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a chewer and most toys don’t last. This toy has lasted for some tugs sessions. It is big enough that my dog carries it and tosses it herself. I haven’t seen her sit down and start chewing on the toy.

It is a softer material so tooth marks became apparent after using. It is slighter smaller than a tennis ball. I would not let a dog chew on this or play alone with it as it would easily come apart. I take it away when we are done playing fetch. Wish it was a different color so I could see it easier in the water.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball is listed as Large but it is not! Looking closer it says dimensions 3x3x3.... which is probably the same size as a tennis ball which is how it arrived.  This size is not large. Beware! This size can get caught in the back of a GS mouth and occlude their airway. I gave this away to someone whose dog is much smaller.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered the large (3"") and received the medium (2.5""). The color is much darker than pictured. I let them know they sent the wrong size and they sent another which I received a couple days later, and it was also a medium size. Too small for a boxer/pit and a pit mix.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These float nice but the dogs swim right past if any other ball is in the water.

Don't leave your dog alone with them if your dog likes to chew and rip toys apart because they are not very durable.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves tennis balls and playing fetch.

Unfortunately, within a couple minutes the inside plastic flattened and then he proceeds to shred the ball. 

I would recommend this toy for playing fetch, it has a nice bounce, the holes on the ball also helps with them breathing right while running but definitely not the toy you can leave for chewing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our border collie/aussie loves this toy! Balls are always a hit, but the cut-out design adds more interest for her. And she loves the scrunchy sound the inside ball makes! At first she was a little afraid of this toy and barked and barked, but it's now a favorite. It rolls and there's the additional advantage that it's really tough and handles well with a determined chewer.  The only drawback is it's heavy and if it's through it clunks down hard and I worry it might accidently hit her, so it's a roll only toy at our house. But this is definately a keeper. We plan to get one in another size soon and maybe even order one for her best friend across the street who is also a chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I thought the concept would be a good change up from the normal ball but Zoey isn’t a fan lol the ball is very well designed and will hold up, it is kinda a harder ball to get to make noise but a larger dog would have no issues!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this for Stan, but right out of the box it was a hit with Joy and Harmony too.  So now all 3 dogs play with it, stopping only to eat and sleep.  So far it's held up very well between the 3 dogs pulling and chewing.  :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The ball was much larger than I expected, so my dog wasn't sure how to manage at first - she's a medium-sized dog (25 lb.). Once she figured out how to approach the ball, she fell in love. It's very loud, so not a great ball for playing fetch indoors, but a nice change of pace from the balls that my dog tends to destroy in no time flat! It seems to be holding up well!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a small min pin/chiuahua and she loves this ball. It's easy for her to carry around but I also take it away when she's done playing because the rubber is soft enough for her to chew up if I leave her unoccupied.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Received our new dog toy.

He doesn't really chew on his balls. He likes to carry them around and retrieve them. We have cheap $1-2 balls that have lasted months, but not this one.

# love KONG</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My JRT (rip Roxy) absolutely loved this ball, which is just as big as she was! She eventually ate the squeaker out, but it frustrated her to no end that she couldn't get the tennis ball out of the middle, LOL!  My GSD, Luna, grabs this ball by a handle and shakes it, making the ball rattle violently inside!  Then she grabs the large rubbery ball's exterior and loves to bite it because it squeaks!  We tell Luna ""Shake it?"" and she does; ""Squeak it!"" and she does. This is a toy that every dog will love -- plus you can play old-school FETCH with it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 105-lb Rottie enjoyed 10 minutes of supervised fun with this toy! We were laughing so hard that our stomachs hurt (her reactions to the sounds, watching her sling the juggler around to get the smaller ball loose, etc.). We walked out of the room for less than TWO MINUTES and returned to scattered pieces!! I had high hopes for this KONG toy, but all toys are not created equal - even if it's a brand you previously trusted as strong enough. Fun while it lasted...all ten minutes worth.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pittie LOVES this ball. He is a super chewer and often destroys toys within minutes. This particular ball has a tennis ball inside and he is SO motivated to try and chew through the ball to get the tennis ball inside. It takes him forever - his last jumbler ball lasted about 6 months. He does eventually chew off the handles, then tries to puncture the middle part. But considering most toys don't last longer than a week, this is perfect for him.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a doggie daycare/boarding business and this ball is a big favorite among all dogs sizes. The handle makes it easy for smaller dogs to carry or they offer a smaller size.  I find that the larger one suits most dogs because it's not heavy. It squeaks too!  This is my 7th one.  The down side is huge mouthed dogs crush it and they sometimes split at the seem.  Still very usable for a while though.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I've gotten this ball a few years ago and it was bigger. This one is still a good size. My boxer's and hound love these balls. They throw them and shake them. I'm giving 4 stars because my one boxer was able to chew through the handle trying to get to the small tennis ball inside. The ball inside is very small. Just make sure you watch them if they start to play with it. My dogs love this toy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy was recommended to me. It became my dogs favorite toy. The squeaker lasted 3 weeks. Pretty good when it’s the only toy being played with. My dog enjoyed biting the squeaker spot and that’s how the squeaker broke. Lol. Although it’s no longer his favorite, we still enjoy playing with it! I love the handles it makes it easier to play tug. I would recommend since I plan on buy another. 
I have a medium dog (43 lb).</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The handle is nice so your dog can pick it up from either side and the rumble the ball makes when it rolls keeps them interested! I’ve had it for a few months now and my dog hasn’t make a dent in it yet and she has some power (Great Dane pup). It’s a great ball that doesn’t roll under your couch too saving your from having to move your furniture to revive it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a really fun toy and for the average dog it would likely last quite a while, unfortunately my dog has realized the best way to take of the two handles. That being said, this toy brings hours of enjoyment to my two dogs and myself and I've purchased two.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Took my boy 5-10 minutes to chew the squeaker out.

Just a few nicks in the hard plastic, I'm sure some day I'll want it to die due to the noise it causes in the house but for now, it's funny to watch him go crazy and entertain himself.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my 7-month-old Beagle's favorite toy.  He will chase it all over the house, especially under beds and furniture and then bark at it until I retrieve it.  It's a fun game for him.  When he is pestering his sister (11-year-old Lab), I can roll it down the hall and redirect him.  It is the ball that I can hide at the bottom of his toy basket and he will dig through everything to find it.  I'm probably order a spare, just in case, but after three weeks of very rough play, it still babbles it's way through our house.  I don't know how long the batteries last but - so far - I'm impressed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have an American Bulldog and she had 0 interest in this ball and even though the talking did not interest her she wasn't actually interested in it all as a ball. I don't know if the slick texture or talking made her not like it but she won't play with this at all, I bought her the hard blue and green Kong ball after this one didn't work and she absolutely love that one. Even though it is a working product, it Just didn't work for us.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball talks in the high pitched voice that dogs seem to like. Some people said their dogs were frightened of it. That was not at all my experience. My (14 week old) puppy loves to push it around and he seems to think he can induce it to play with him because he keeps making play bows. It's wonderful fun to watch.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I would not recommend this item poor quality. Because it stopped working after one time being used. I changed out the old batteries with new ones. And it still didn't work. I followed the instructions to the T.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball makes my dogs go crazy. They love when the ball talks and the fact that it hasn’t broken after so many falls is awesome! This is currently their favorite toy. :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We love this ball.  Have a smaller one too.   Not sure if our dog lives it or hates it but he plays with them a lot.  Usually when we are trying to watch the news but that’s O. K.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">If it had been a LITTLE tougher to withstand her aggressive jaws, it would have been wonderful!! The first little bit, she LOVED IT!! But, we had to give it a trashcan burial just like the other toys....</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this ball and my puppy loved it. Unfortunately it stopped working after a few days. I read reviews and see that changing the battery doesn't make it work again.</span>]"

This ball is by far the best 4$ I’ve ever spent on my dog. He loves it !! He is a strong chewer he likes to tear out the sqeaker so this ball with a sleeve is perfect for him.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 10 month old puppy is GREAT at shredding most toys, including a variety of ball toys.  This tennis ball with a rubber sleeve has really challenged him.  We have had them for weeks, and he has yet to to even put a dent in them.  He also loves to chew on them at length, and will bat them around with his paws, which is cute to watch.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Im so happy with this purchase. This is the 4th ball we had to get as she breaks the squeaker on the same day so I looked into this and saw the rubber around the ball and so far the ball has lasted!!! It is durable! She absolutely loves it! I’m thinking of buying more just to have as they worked great! Thank you Chewy</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves fetch. She destroys tennis balls. The cover works great.  I’ve bought several and she’s only destroyed one so far.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My baby loves her new toy. It has a soft bounce which is great. She's too small to pick it up at times but it's good for her teeth and when she gets it her tail waves from side to side!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My hard chewing German Shepherd loves these. Because of the outer rubber shell, the tennis ball lasts much longer. The squeak, which my gsd loves, doesn’t last as long as it should but it hangs on la manger than the squeaking tennis balls. But even squeak-less, my gsd will walk around chewing on this as if it’s a wad of bubble gum. My smaller dogs just carry it in their mouths—it’s too hard for them to chew on it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It's easier to grab a hold and toss. Olive enjoys the texture on her teeth as well! It allows her to keep a hold easier. It's great for playing catch in water because the bright blue helps you to be able to spot the ball from long distances during day or night.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We are a Frenchie Fam and our queen Frenchie she kills the squeaker all the time within 10 minutes this ball w/ sleeve has lasted and they all love it, it’s a toy they all love playing keep away so it does it’s job all pups are getting their exercise.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was hoping my dog would love this toy but he wouldn't touch it at all. Oh well I tried back to small squeaker ball's and toys for him.... like the fish I also purchased. So for doggies who didn't like this ball try the small fish 3 pack!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">wonderful toy, when my boy stops playing with it, I just put in a new squeaker ball and he gets right back to playing.</span>]"

When it arrived I saw the only openings to the middle were the holes in top and bottom. My dog still loves the toy and is getting used to having to chew to retrieve her treat. Does anyone have recommendations for good treats to stuff in this one?</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 11 week old puppy gets the treats out in less then 5 minutes. The slots are too shallow and the treats come out very easily. You have to have a tiny, tiny treat as I do but they still are too easy to get out. Going to look for something a little more complicated to keep him busy. The ball itself is study though and stands up to chewing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The dog really likes this because the kibble falls out way to easily.  One side has a smaller opening and the other a larger opening.  I'm going to try string cheese sticks to see if this keeps her busy longer.  However, if you're feeding a kibble meal using this ball, it would work well.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Not what I expected but Zoey loves it! The Kong treats are easy to insert into the ballot toy. For whatever reason, Zoey does not chew on this ball when it is empty. If only Zoey would bring the ball back to me when she is done! Would buy this ball again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Every dog is different. My black lab plays with this toy a lot. She has learned to nudge the ball with her nose to dislodge treats and when we bounce it for her, she scans the impact radius for her “reward”.  She is not a strong chewer so I know this will last a long time, assuming it doesn’t roll into a dark, hidden place!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have other Kong toys for our aggressive chewing Lab and they’ve held up very well.  He’s been able to chew some chunks off the end of this one though.  Not sure it’s as good as the others.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have been giving him some bully sticks and beef tendons, which he proceeded to swallow about a 4"" bully stick piece whole, one time choking on a beef tendon &amp; we had to reach down his throat to pull it out. I had one of these Kong Ball Toys, in which I shoved through the tiny hole on one end, and it protrudes out the larger end, making it more difficult to swallow the chews. This toy, along with other Kongs, such as the Puppy and Original, have literally been lifesavers for my puppy. Now for the way this toy is meant to be used, he loves the Kong spread, or peanut butter placed in the cracks. I haven't added any small treats in the center hole yet though, but I'm sure he'll love that too.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My rescue hound is scared of squeak toys and I can tell she's bored. The only toy she has shown any interest in is a rope toy but it doesn't hold her attention. I got this and stuffed chicken jerky treats into the slits. She loves it and it entertains her for a while. She actually plays with it</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I literally just took it out of the box and gave it to my dog. He enjoyed it, but ripped the bottom off in literal minutes. Do not recommend, if you have a power chewer like mine.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’m used to Kong items really holding up to my strong chewer.  This already has a lot of pieces chewed off. It would probably be good for a light chewer.</span>]"

First time she caught it she chomped her usual strength and it split right open! I always watch close with these because they have been chewed up (the horror stories I've heard!) Won't get these again!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I've been buying/playing with these for years. At first I was surprised to see they weren't offered in the 4-pack. Upon receipt, and immediately playing with the balls I noticed that Reno popped the balls quickly and easily. There has been no change in Reno's health or aggression, (he's a happy Border Collie), and he doesn't pop regular tennis balls. I love Chewy so I thought you should get honest feedback on the products you carry.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Dutch Shepard is not a particularly aggressive chewer. But once he dropped it into his water bucket, it split almost immediately. WAY too expensive for something that isn't durable!
I've started using the Breathe Right Fetch balls and they are much better. The dog can actually breathe through the open construct of the ball and water doesn't harm it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 9 lab pups (and their mama) love these! Small enough for them to carry around, and easy to grip with the tennis ball fuzziness.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I love the fact that these are orange so that I can find them in the woods when I over throw.  I love that they stay orange even through a coating of mud. They hold up well even after being chewed on by two dogs who try to defuzz them. We have only had to replace them when my husband chucks them deep into the brush.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Lasted with my 15 month old shepherd at least 90 minutes. The nerf balls &lt; 5 min. I’m just going for good old fashioned tennis balls lol</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a mini Aussie who is all about the ball life! The chuck it lets me throw them way out, and the orange is super visible for the ones she doesn’t see. My only complaint is that they break too easily. This is our second package because they always break right along the seam, usually within a few weeks.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Only had item for 15 minutes and my small dog smashed it in half already. He never breaks toys</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">There ok. We bought them for our smaller dog to be able to fetch in water. After a bit the balls filled with water and sank. But perfect for on land.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Balls split in half very quickly after a few tosses and when thrown into the pool -they sink.  We buy them because of the color.  They’re easier to see in the grass.  An actual yellow tennis ball is higher quality and doesn’t fall apart but blends into the lawn easier.</span>]"

Not only does she use the rope to shake the ball like prey (she loves when it hits back) but she devised a game of herding using two of these balls. She goes through about 4 of these a year but she plays with them every time we go outside. My only complaint is that I wish the ropes were sturdier as they unravel and try to come out of the hole in the ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We simply referred to this as playing Red Ball. Our golden has passed away but this was one of her all time favorites outside. I loved it because it was great in the snow. The rope made it easy to whip with gloves on, and the oversized ball made it easy to find and fetch even at night. It was always comical watching her drag it back to me with her head held proud and high. I wouldn’t just leave it alone with a strong chewer. I’d say this is more of an interactive toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 100 # lab Puppy loves the jolly ball. The big rubber ball is tough and will hold up to his meat shredder teeth. Unfortunately...he destroyed the rope in less than 15 minutes ! I’ve replaced the rope at least 4 times in a week. I used heavy nylon rope but still he gnashes that up too. Wish I could find something he couldn’t destroy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this a year ago for my two young boxers but didn't really have much hope for it's longevity due to the rope and my dog's love of chewing up rope toys. Much to my surprise the rope lasted until today! It stays outside in all kinds of weather and Sun drenched backyard. I will be buying another one today, this is a great product!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I thought this was a hard plastic but it’s rubber a hard rubber but my guy is a pro at chewing I have only few that he can destroy this was in 20mins it’s still good but I have to watch him now he’s eating it lol but he absolutely loves it and I’ll buy more!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">But.. the rope has already been destroyed.  She will still be able to play with the ball.. but the rope lasted all of maybe a half hour lol.  So my sweet girl loves this toy.. but she’s a chewer and this definitely did not last long</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is much larger than I thought it was. I got the 8"" ball. So my dogs kind of have a hard time with it once it gets wet. It seems to take on a lot of water considering it's a water toy I thought that was strange.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I just recently bought this for my 8mth old Rottweiler. She absolutely loves it. I held off on writing a review cause I want sure of the durability it did show signs of teeth marks in the ball really soon &amp; because of that I want sure it wld hold up but because of how much she loved it I had my fingers crossed &amp; it's been close to a month of really rough play &amp; aside from the dinks in the ball which don't hurt anything it's fine. I highly recommend it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 6 month old Bernedoodle loves this toy!   She plays with it alone or we throw it and play tug of war.    She also plays with it with her dog friends that come to visit!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We got this ball because my mother in-law had a similar one at her house and our dog loved it. It was very hard when we got it and our dog proceeded to chew on it and play with the rope. We had it for a little over a month now and she still loves it. She chews on the ball and carries it around by both the ball itself or the rope.  She loves to play tug with it and play fetch with it as well.  The ball is now more pliable than it was when it arrived due to her chewing on it. It's stays outside at all times and is holding up really well.  No actual holes through the ball and even if there were it still would function as it. It's been a great addition to the outside toy options.</span>]"

Shes a sucker for any toy that rolls so this toy really entertains her. It really does tease her because she wants to get to the ball inside but it rolls away from her so she has to chase it and try again. The product is plastic so I can definitely see that if not monitored she could probably chew right through it. Although I’m not too worried right now since she gets tired from it rolling away from her and takes a break. Score! (Sometimes I can’t play so this toy is awesome) I got a size small and she is about 45lbs, perfect size for her to hold. Shipping was fast as well, thanks chewy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is obsessed with this ball. He loves to play soccer around the yard with this yipping and barking as he tries to get the inside ball. Once he tires out he will lay down and try to pull the small ball out. This toy was originally bought for another dog who didn’t have interest in it, but mine absolutely loves it. He has had this toy for over a year and a half - and spent a lot of time trying to get it apart and has just succeeded! He plays with both pieces still. He is a super chewer but surprisingly it took time to chew through this toy. This was well worth the money and will be buying again. Great to play with your dog with and to occupy your dog in its own.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our girl, Nagi Bear has zero interest in this ball. Which is a real bummer because it was suggested to me for our super chewer. Unfortunately, when we opened it and gave it to her she just pushed it around for a few seconds with her nose and walked away. The next morning I took it outside to the yard to see if kicking it around would entice her but still no interest. She found more joy sniffing the grass blades individually, lol. This is probably a great toy for some, Nagi Bear just didn't get it. I gave it two stars for durability and speed of shipment.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This states on the box it is not a chew toy. It is not. My large 6 month old German Shepherd puppy enjoyed this for a short time but when he realized the inside ball would not come out he got bored with it and would start to chew it or pick it up and carry it along and drop it and ignore it. It’s hard plastic so you do have to watch your dog with it that he doesn’t chew the plastic into sharp edges.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My two-year-old lab has destroyed many toys in just minutes. She’s had this magical blue ball for about four months, and is still completely enraptured. Just infatuated by it. It’s sturdy enough to handle her teeth and interesting enough to keep her focus for HOURS on end. Chesler is extremely social and usually jumps on people when they come in the house. But when people come over to hang out in the yard, I give her this magical blue ball and she couldn’t care less about the visitors. It’s a great party trick, because no one has ever seen a dog so transfixed. It is my only rival for the position of her best friend, and I’m totally okay with that.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball would be great for dogs who don’t grip down super tight on it. We have two German Shepherds and they like the ball but in just a few days, put groves in the hard plastic leaving sharp edges all over it. We are concerned they might get cut on the edges. On a positive side it is a fun ball for our shepherd who holds another toy in his mouth and plays with the ball as if he were playing soccer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a very busy Corgi puppy. She enjoys playing with this altho she isn’t super fascinated by it. It is sturdy and will hold up to her hard chewing. She can make a bit of racket throwing it about as the outer ball is hard plastic. If you live in an apartment and your dog really goes nuts playing with it this could be something to be aware of. It helps keep her occupied tho.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">He really enjoys playing with this in the yard. He is a super chewer and this does the trick to occupy him, but I'm worried that the bite marks on the plastic are going to cut his mouth. Kind of wish the plastic was thicker (like kong material).</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Yes it already has bite marks where he chomped down on it but he’s a chewer!  He initially just kept carrying it around the yard. However, round two he started to nudge it and pass at it to roll it and when he got tired he started chomping on it. That’s what we do though!  The holes are big enough for him to stick his entire bottom jaw in. He even played fetch with it a few times too. It was self entertaining for short periods of time which is excellent!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Sorry to say my two fur loves do not like the teaser ball . Maybe it’s the hard plastic ?? They LOVE their other jolly puncture proof balls  That we play w all day every day outside in the yard . Especially our 2 year old shepherd .

I purchased two balls and expect them to last my 50-lb. terrier mix mutts years of fun- a lifetime compared to other dog toys out there and on par with the best quality products Kong offers.

BE ADVISED, these balls are NOT hollow. They are dense and heavy and the medium size would serve a pretty hard blow even to my 50lb. adults if they go for a head-on catch. We've been using them more as chase and catch as they bounce.

I'll be honest, my two guys have never paraded a toy in the way they do this ball. They are VERY pleased and love to show it off. It will be a handy tool. We've gone numerous play sessions outside</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 2 1/2 year old energetic lab just loves his bouncy ball.

He always end up bitting the tennis balls so they crack in half only after a couple uses, I thought this ball would correct this problem and it did, I just wish it was a little bigger so it would fit in the chuck it better, its a little smaller than a normal size tennis ball which is almost a little small for a large dog...thats the only reason for the 4 stars, other than that its super durable and worth the money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves this toy. This toy is by far his favorite. However, if you like a quiet house I don’t recommend, because this toy does bounce and my 100 pound dog chases after it LOL.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My small but aggressive chewer still has this ball. Other balls I have gotten have not lasted as long. She will start with the hole and chew off the edges. Tennis balls she just mutilates, some balls lasted all of 5 minutes.

Not the strongest toy for super chewers but my pup likes to play tug o war with it and whip it around like a crazy animal. You can understand why it didn't last super long. Worth the money to replace it though since he loves it so much. There is a cheaper version that's their basic wubba but it's not nearly as cute.

I probably wouldn’t get this for a dog who can shred up things easily, (if your specifically looking for a long lasting toy) as he’s only a puppy and has torn it up quite a bit within the first few hours of having it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog went absolutely bonkers over this.  Within a few weeks he was pulling out stuffing, and had the plastic with beads out.  He is still carrying it around.  I don't know if it was the slight rattle or what, but it is his new favorite.  I can't be sad he tore it up.  He is a small snauzer but usually has things torn up within a day, the reason I choose Kong, they last longer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My little Yorkie loved this little toy. I always buy kong because of the quality and sturdiness. Not with this toy. Material pulled out of the seam so the interior toy parts came out. Luckily I was watching. Great toy if it hadn't been junk.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Kong toys never disappoint. All time favorite is still the Wubba, but Moose comes in at a close second. Super cute toy when carrying around, my dog loves the texture and the squeak.

It's the perfect size for our 40 lb puppy who still needs something to chew on at all times. I like that the center is hollowed out, it's easy for him to carry around.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Perfect sized toy for our 8 week old golden retriever. While she has not made it squeak yet, she is really into softer chew toys that are similar fabric to our slippers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my pups favorite toy by far. Well constructed, plenty of action, (3 different squeakers and fluffy sound and crunchy sound) and light! We play tug of war with it even! Great toy and worth the price,!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My little Yorkie loved this toy!  She barked at the Chewy box until I opened it up for her to dig out her new toys!  Chewy is her favorite package of the month!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Just a warning about this toy...when my dog chews it, the material gets stuck in her teeth and has to be pulled out of her mouth.  I should have thrown it away sooner because tonight she got a piece hung on her tooth and halfway down her throat.  She kept periodically gagging.  I had to stick my finger in her mouth and pull it out.  She's fine now.</span>]"

He loves balls, but always ends up taring them apart so I thought this would be a great alternative. Unfortunately, within less than 5 minutes with the toy he was able to sink his teeth into the blue part of the ball. The interior seems sturdy, but the little letters and the blue rubber had been pulled off/had teeth dents within only a few minutes of him playing with it.

Highly recommend this to anyone with tough chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball will hold up to anything but none of the dogs care for it because it’s so hard! I actually purchased two of them because of the hardness of them, I haven’t needed to open the other one yet. I’m at the dog park everyday and as some know that go to them... other dogs tend to play with your dogs toys and this ball is not a favorite because they can’t sink their teeth into it. It’s an awesome ball if your dog will play with it. It bounces high, lasts long and will survive a rapid chewer.</span>]"

These ones are awesome! My only improvement would be if they would float better in water.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My mini dachshund LOVES the glow balls. Her second favorite are the breathe easy ones(not in this pack). This pack let her try two other chuck it balls. She likes them all but still knows which is the glow ball and she takes it everywhere with her. It glows so bright at night for playing fetch. Well worth the money she can chew up tennis balls and other ball brands but so far Chuck it balls dont RIP or crack.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I dont own the chuck it stick yet but my pup loves the variety and gets so excited to squish them! And the best part is they don’t squeak so she doesnt keep me up at night 10/10 recommend!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I had bought a Harts brand rubber ball and my beagle loved to play fetch with it.

They stand up to the constant chewing of my seven year old Doberman. The good part  is she loves to play with them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Funny enough, we don't have a Chuckit! and I bought these simply because of the material they are made out of and the fact that my lab mix loves balls. She is a MAJOR chewer and can chew off bits of the BLACK KONG, it's actually amazing to see. She has yet to get a piece out of the orange whistle ball or the blue rubber recycled ball. Incredible! I have not played with the glow ball yet because she has had so much fun with the other two. They bounce great and are highly visible as well. They don't have a rubber smell to them and I love that they are recycled too. Great purchase!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pit pup LOVES these! I love them because they last!

And I would still buy them anyway just for the times we can actually get more playtime before they’re gone. I bought these and cannot believe that all three are still instant and they have access to them! I would definitely buy again and recommend to those whose dog chews up regular tennis balls. I’m so happy to finally be able to not waste my money on the regular ones.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dogs love chasing these balls. Put them in the chucker handle and throw them. We use two balls because when they bring the one back it teaches them to drop the ball and then we throw the other one. Angus doesn't always drop the ball so using two works great for us.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have and Australian Blue Heeler mix and she loves to play fetch.
With the Chuck-it  at the local park I can throw the ball well over 60 yards and our dog often will catch it on the second or third bounce. She has so much fun that I have to eventually tell her it is time to go, because she would continue until she can't run anymore!

It’s difficult to find a toy that can stand up to rough play but soft enough to be safe for the dog to shake with enthusiasm.
Most toys that have I have seen with  ropes attached have a solid ball at the end that can damage sensitive ear flaps.
The toy comes fully equipped with crackly material and squeaker built into the balloon part of the toy.
The rope attached is sturdy but pliable.
The only improvement I would have made would be a change in material covering the ball to a canvas texture instead of the plush so it would be better suited for outdoor fun and doggie slobber.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My now 1 yr old puppy is in Love w/this! I can dangle it and she will jump at it or I can toss it and she will retrieve it! So far, she hasn't chewed it up, as she does w/many of her toys. She Loves to grab the rope end and either try to grab it in mid air when I swing it or grab the rope end and bring it to me. She's only a 12 lb Peke and I found this size to suit her well! Am now thinking of getting her another. So far, I found this to be a tougher toy for her as some she's chewed right through in no time!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The pibble loved it and especially liked the extra long rope. He played with it for a month or so before he decided to easily decapitate it and de-squeaker it. It's definitely meant for a medium to light chewer who is a little more on the gentle side. It's a fun toy and he definitely enjoyed it, even if it isn't quite strong enough for him.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a new puppy and she loves this toy!!!  She loves the balloon part, to crinkle and squeak and the rope is her favorite! She has got my older dog to play with her, this was originally his toy and he never got into it ( but he only likes tennis balls )! I’m ordering a new one because the puppy has unraveled the rope half way. I will probably put a extra knot at the end to hopefully prevent that from happening again.

Then again, she loves all ball toys. I bought a ton of these of different sizes. She is about 42lb lab/whippet. The most comfortable size for her is the small, though it constantly gets stuck underneath the couch. I only wish they had a size between the small and medium as that medium is rather large and that way it wouldn't get stuck underneath things so easily.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is supposedly good for chewers, but our 7 month puppy got it pulled apart in less than an hour.

The toy that works for us is the “Tuff Stick”.  He can get it untied, and he bites it into pieces, but it doesn’t come apart in long strings...it gets chewed into various rope lengths.

She is easily able to hold it in her mouth, vs the smooth glow in the dark chuckit ball that is always popping out of her mouth. My yard is good sized, but not enormous and this gives plenty of distance for my old girl to run and get some energy out. I am able to throw the ball with the chuckit handle diagonally from one corner of the yard to the other and thats plenty of distance for us.

My three year old red nose pittie is a toy annihilator. She has destroyed every single toy ever given to her, including kong extremes, within a day or two of getting them. This ball has now lasted almost a week and it’s still intact! It’s just big enough that she can just get her mouth around it and squeak it but she can’t tear it up! She’s been trying since she got it and so far so good! There are some obvious teeth indentations and scratches but no holes or rips! She even claws at with both front paws like a crazy lady and can’t make a dent! I don’t think it’ll last forever but it’s lasted longer than any other ball or toy we’ve gotten</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My giant rottie, Bo, absolutely LOVES this ball. Like seriously, seriously LOVES it. I tried to give him a treat to get the ball away from him, and he chose the ball over a treat - unheard of! My one warning is that the squeaker is VERY loud. On the other hand, I think the squeaker is precisely why he loves it so much. Another thing to note, is that this ball will be destroyed - this is not our first one. But for $4 and the joy it brings him while it is intact and even after it is destroyed (yes, he carried around and played with pieces of it after destroying his first one) it's well worth it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have been trying new brands and toys to see how they hold up to my toy destroyer puppy. This one has a squeaker that lasts a bit longer than the others because air just blows through it to squeak. It met it’s end when the sqeuaker was pulled out. The material is really sturdy though. We still play fetch with it (supervised of course) with the hole in it. The hole has been there for a LONG time and he has only gotten off that small piece of material while chewing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog just loves these balls. he loves to fetch them, jump in the air to catch them, and squeak them till his mama is about to go crazy. I rarely take them away when that happens as he gets so much joy out of them. He's not real good at bringing them all the way back when playing fetch, so we've ordered about 20 of them, half large and half medium and now we all have fun!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I wouldn't recommend this if your dog likes to chew, only if you are playing fetch supervised. My puppy loved this, however it didn't even last a month before he got the squeaker out, essentially leaving a hole for him to chew up the ball also. There are tougher squeaky balls out there.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is one of the few toys that my 45 lb Blue Lacy has not tore up. The ball is made of a sturdy rubber not too hard or too soft. It has a squeaker that she nor our Jack Russell has been able to remove. It has a good bounce to it so we use it a lot for indoor play. They love it and that is all that matters. Thanks Chewy !</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog (a 90lb Malinois Mix) found one of these balls at the park and fell in love with it. She's a heavy chewer and likes to chew balls like bubblegum. So when the freebie ball started to develop large rips near the hole, I thought I'd buy her a new one. I assumed the ball she found was the size Large, so I ordered that. I was super surprised when it arrived and was much larger than I expected. I'd catagorize the Large size as Extra Large. She can still fit it in her mouth, but she prefers when balls are smaller and still favors the old one. Overall, I'd recommend this item, but consider the sizing when purchasing. This ball is good quality for the price.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I might actually get her to play fetch because of this ball! She usually goes for soft, plush squeaky toys, so finding a ball she likes is impossible. Until now. She chases it, and takes it to her bed to chew on. She's not a power chewer, so I can't say how durable it is, but she sure loves it! This is Mayzie, our Australian Kelpie with her new favorite toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These balls squeaker has gotten so cheap my dog will break it in 15 minutes, I have bought about 50 in my dogs life time and they are so bad I will not purchase this ball again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My big Shepherd loves this ball, carries it with him.

My super chewer, squeaker-destroyer, 8 month old pup tore through and de-stuffed the boomerang design in 30 minutes flat. Since I’d bought a football with the boomerang, I went ahead and gave it to him. He loves the football shape since he can pick it up and actually use his jaws to squeeze and squeak it himself and it pops back into shape after 1 squeeze. I think it lasted so long because the seam angles were completely new to him (not a flat toy). It lasted a 1.5 months, which is a new record on any stuffed toy so far!

This product (large size) is the only one that has survived.  We like this strap ball enough to have purchased three pairs, the oldest pair having lasted through daily chasing, catching, thrashing, and chewing in the outdoors for 2.5 years.  The photos show that they have been frayed and faded, but are still in use.  Yes, that's our dog; she is very possessive and parades around with all 6 of her prizes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a chew-monster who can eat (literally eat) a tennis ball in &lt;10 minutes while walking. Normal Chuckit! balls last a few hours. This Chuckit! has lasted 9 months! I think that the rope attachment inside actually prevents him from being able to bite clean through the ball or tear chunks out of it. It's still holding on, but has some cracks and punctures now, so we'll be purchasing a replacement. 

Some notes: 
1) Early on I scolded him for chewing on the rope part and he's mostly left it alone since he prefers chewing on the ball anyway, but if your pup loves nylon rope, I can't speak to how well that part holds up. 
2) We once forgot this toy outside in the sun for week and it was</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Another one that went into the toy graveyard instead of the toy box.

She has taken to playing with herself she's realized if she drops it off the end of the couch or the top of the 2 step drop off it bounces and she can play catch with herself (funny because she won't play catch with me) she runs after it usually hitting it with her paws trying to get it sending it rolling/bouncing further and it's just fun to watch overall. She plays with it and will chew at it a bit but I guess she doesn't like chewing it as much because she leaves it be and doesn't try to rip it open like normal tennis</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">While this ball was ideal because it did not squeek, it turns out our lab mix puppy is an extreme chewer, and she bit pieces off within 30 minutes.

It’s much smaller than I thought it would be. But he loves it anyway.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This product is made in two halves and those two halves are terribly fused together.  This was destroyed by half in minutes.  I glued it back and returned it to pup and it lasted another five.  It broke in half like it was assembled and shows in the photo.  It isn’t at all like all of the other Kong products I have and I just wanted a ball to throw to my big dog.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We had purchased the Kong Crackle Stick for our 70 lb 1 year old English Bull Terrier months ago and he loved it, but he was able to chew through it and destroy it. I saw this toy and thought ""oh my god its literally his crackle stick in ball form"". Safe to say after over an hour of play, it has survived and he absolutely loves it. Definitely a good toy for anyone who has dogs who are extremely intrigued by sounds and love to make sounds!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I heard no crackle to the ball at all  but on the bright side it’s still in one piece I have hard chewers in m6 house.</span>]"

If you put smaller treats obviously more will come out at once. If you have a clever dog then they will figure it out very quickly. My dog is a medium/small Boston Terrier so no issues as others reported with jaw getting stuck. Watch your pets and shouldn’t have any issues. Only  reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because it does let a few to many treats out with small treats (just find something larger as I did and it correct that problem) and it is a simple pattern and the pups figured it out really quick. Outside of that seems to be great.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Very disappointed in this food dispensing toy.  My nine week old puppy found this toy to be far too easy and could empty it in just a few minutes.  Defeated the purpose of keeping my puppy occupied!  With every push or nudge, the toy dumped large quantities of treats out.  It took little to no effort.  My puppy liked that he could easily pick it up, but that’s the only good thing about it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">When it is too hot or too rainy to get my dogs a good run in, I use treat toys to help release built up energy. This toy is fantastic!! They can roll it or pick it up. I love to watch them play with it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My maltipoos were a bit frustrated at first. I guess after I got down on the floor at their level &amp; played with them same as a toddler that they love to play with it now together. 
I put their regular food in it now.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loved it and it was fun for her. Sometimes the dog food came out too fast and not very durable.  My friends 2 year old picked it up and dropped it and it snapped. I was super bummed</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was very disappointed with this item.  Maybe it was my dog but it was destroyed within an hour.  I have ordered similar products in the past and was very pleased.  Not so much with this one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this to entertain my girl on her ""hyper"" days. She is a 85 lb bloodhound mix. She loves this ball because she gets to push it around and it drops treats. I have not had the problems that others have posted about. Some treats fall out but not a giant amount at once. The only problem I have seen is that sometimes my dog will want to pick it up and her bottom jaw has gotten stuck in it. So warning, if u have a bigger dog watch them with this incase they get their jaw stuck in it too. Other than that have had no problem with it. Her eyes lite up every time I pull it out lol</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 8 year old and 3 month old dog love it.  They were fighting over who was playing with it!  This is great for the puppy to keep her mind busy and learn new things.   I am going to have to buy another one plus a lot of treats to put inside it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I am so disappointed with this toy. My 2 great dane pups loved this toy. However, it broke within a week of getting it. I am not even sure how it broke. The blue tube inside that the treat can come out of broke off. The dogs could not even get to it so not sure how it manged to break. But once it was broken it does not even work as a ball to chase because the blue part is what holds it together. I would love to try another one but not willing to spend any more money on something that lasted a week.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My staffy mix is very smart and loves puzzle toys, but tends to destroy them quickly. This treat ball has held up surprisingly well. It’s covered in teeth marks but still intact after a week. It’s nice to find a toy for him that will last longer than a single use. My only complaint is that the holes the treats come out of may be a little big for most training treats. I’ve found that for me the treats that work best are Merrick Power Bites and Bones &amp; Chews Freeze-dried treats which are both a little bigger than most training treats.</span>]"

It’s his and our favorite toy so far!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I first saw this ball on FaceBook in a pupper's mouth.  I laughed and laughed.  I went to Chewy's website to see if I could find it. I FOUND IT!  I noticed that it came in three sizes ( I had to really look for that info).  I bought it for my Eskie in a medium and for a new puppy in a small.  Both dogs LOVE their ""Teeth"" ball.  It's big hit!  Put treats inside and watch the fun!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Great toy! We have 3 medium to large dogs.

I did and he loves playing with it and getting the treat!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This Kong ball is well worth the price paid.  It’s a softer material that is great for fetching and it floats.  There’s also a hole like traditional Kongs have for stuffing in treats, too.  Durable item, too—-it’s survived 3 months with heavy use from our poodle pack.

We purchased a size “large” for our Standard Poodles and this toy has been a big hit.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">If you can get your dog to hold this toy the right way... it’s absolutely hilarious &amp; will bring laughter to many! It’s surprisingly durable but tiny, so I recommend supervision during playtime.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The small is about the size of a plum.  I have a Boston Terrier and ordered the small based on the review of someone with the same breed.  I am going to donate it and order a medium.  My girl is only 18 pounds but she would be able to fit the entire ball in her mouth which seems risky.  I'm not going to take it out of the package to find out, but I know the medium will be much safer for her.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got a small one for my Boston/spaniel pupper. Loves to retrieve and play fetch. So far she has been unable to damage it. Would buy it again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Was so excited to give these as a gift to my daughters dogs. Both were destroyed in less than 5 minutes. I got the medium size and paid way more for them than the small or large. Don’t waste your money. I didn’t even get one picture:(</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I recently ordered this for my 6 month Blue Heeler / boarder collie. I thought the small would be ok. I defiantly should have gotten a bigger one since the small was waaaay too small. Within 5 mins of just having it, it was already destroyed. He loved it for the time being. The rubber is pretty thin so if your dog is very delicate with toys, I would recommend it would be ok for them.</span>]"

The rope lasted less than 30 seconds. She then chewed the bottom off, removing the insert that makes it float. It sank to the bottom of the lake. The best retrieving water toys so far have been the floating ""indestructable"" bones by a couple different manufactures. None have lasted more than a couple months but still much longer than this one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">No matter that our dog will often “lose” the toy in the water, this is the toy to use for water play! It floats and it can be thrown long distances and the only part that is destructible is the rope...but even that lasts a very long time. Best toy ever for water work especially!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Most of the bad reviews on here are probably because their dog was chewing on the rope. I have an extremely high energy super chewer, and after tossing it in the ocean a few times and Maggie bringing it back, she was out like a light. The cardio workout for this thing is outstanding!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a good sturdy toy if your dog is small. It is too small for my German Shepherd.

She had chewed through the rope part of this toy withing five minutes of getting it out of the packaging and was already coughing up some of the particles.

My dog LOVES this ball, and I think the texture is the reason why. He is OBSESSED with it, to use a very overused but apt term.

Hope it lasts a long, long time!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">One throw and it was a fail. Design of ball doesn't allow for a bounce on lawn. the Breathe right gimmick sounds amazing but discovered if you get the right size ball for your dog or perhaps size down Dog can breathe just as well.

I love that my dog can breathe better with it and its a softer catch when your throwing it as I always worried about his teeth. Be sure to get the right size for your dog to avoid any kind of chocking hazard. Too many people buy the med ball when the avg med to large breed dog needs the XL!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I can't complain about this product.

She manages to tear through every toy she has, but this one has been proven to be extremely durable. The squeak is a bit loud, however this makes it even more fun and exciting for my pup. Overall, I absolutely love this toy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">When it said large I assumed it was large, it is actually rather small. Read the specs on it first, I did not or I would have ordered something much larger. Our dog loves it though, it's a great inside ball because of the size but not what I was anticipating. I was hoping for a larger outside ball for our border collie to play fetch with. Great ball but don't think large should be used to describe it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this for my boxer girl for the back yard ..... she was excited when she seen Chewy box and this ball was a big hit !!!!  She plays with it every morning.... LOL</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Got the ball out of the box and was excited to let our Jack Russell and Pit Bull play with it but less than 15 minutes later it was punctured by the Jack. He wasn’t even being really rough with it just squeaking it and it popped. Really disappointed to be honest both pups were excited over how loud it could squeak...</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The ball itself seems pretty durable. However my dog is an aggressive chewer and the squeaking stopped about 5-10 minutes in. So for the squeaking I would give it a 1. But the ball itself he still enjoys and he hasn’t torn apart.</span>]"

These balls are his favorite to chew on to relieve stress and boredom. They are tough enough to last several weeks of chewing but soft enough that he can grab them with his mouth. He likes to carry something when we walk and the handle makes it easy without straining his jaws over a long period.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our girl Lucy loves using these as a tug toy and modifying them so they “flap” better when she shakes the heck out of them—she starts with removing the handle so she can put her foot in the hole to pin the ball down and better pull off parts to modify the shape. Even when they appear to be destroyed scraps to other people, she still loves playing with them. Worth every cent, she’s had some of them for years now.

We never leave our dogs unsupervised with toys, so chewing on it wasn't an issue. We also have a jolly pets romp n roll rope ball which seems to be made better and is still in good shape. Very disappointed that this ball only lasted 4 days.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was really excited about this toy!  Unfortunately, my dog had the handle chewed off within the first hour!

The handle on top was completely chewed off and all over the house. The ball is left and has a lot of holes in it.

She shakes it like prey, and loves to tease us with it. If your dog habitually chews up toys, this one resists destruction. However, that does not mean it's 100% indestructible. Not all dogs are highly serious chewers, but if yours is, he/she may get small pieces off the handle. I absolutely recommend this toy. I got the 10 inch one for my GSD.

I got the large, and because they felt hard compared to the other ones on display, I thought for sure they would last a little longer than the whimpy smaller ones,  but within 2 hours of giving one of these to my dog, the two halves were separated. Holy crap! Why do they make such garbage? 

Bad thing is, the smaller ones were already separated while brand new and hanging on the store displays.  I should have known,  but they are sneaky enough to glue the halves together just enough to fool you when you feel them in the store.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">While Kong has historically had good products, we were very disappointed in these.

It slows his eating down so he doesn't inhale his food &amp; gives us a moment to prepare our own meals.  I  would not  leave this  with  a pet unattended once it was empty- frustration might lead to destruction/ingestion although 3 months of use &amp; we've got scratches but no cracks or breakage.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Got this on a whim in search for the ""best"" new toy for a VERY mouthy puppy!  This little guy absolutely loves this thing.  My 8wk old is perfect for the small one but will need a bigger one as he grows.  I don't love putting food in it (or treats) because if he doesn't finish them it's just sitting on the floor.  Even empty he lives for it and the ball in the middle makes it less likely to get stuck under furniture.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Older dog went blind and thought this would be fun to put some treats in and allow him to play again. He ate the ball, sonit doesn't roll anymore and ate the ring around it, to where it is too sharp to give him anymore. He did enjoy it for 2 days though.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this for my dog when he was a puppy and it’s lasted now for quite some time. He’s now 2yo. He tosses it around and rolls it all over. 10/10 would recommend for most dogs. 

If your dog is a heavy chewer, may not recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Stormageddon loves this thing. My vet sent me one about a year ago with the rest of a package, but between her learning not to chew through the ring and being left outside in the weather, the center stopped rotating cleanly. I ordered a replacement from Chewy and it's wonderful to have back in the house. Stormy tends to be able to ""outsmart"" some of the other puzzle toys and plows through them too fast, this is a little more driven by chance so it's more of a surprise when a treat/food is delivered.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We got this toy from our vet about a year ago, and use it as a special treat for them.  Our boys love this toy.  They are aggressive chewers, so the red tube around the ball didn't last too long, BUT the blue ball can still be used.  When the boys try to chew on the ball to break it open, it doesn't break, there are just some scratches left on the ball (they're larger golden retrievers, a dog with a bigger mouth like a mastiff could have more success in breaking it open).  I'm re-ordering, as the scratches on the outside of the ball have grown and hair is now starting to stick to it (but the ball is still intact and they still love it).</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a Border Collie and Beagle cross. I feed her with this style treat ball pretty often and she is quite skilled with these. So far this is my favorite because you can actually clean it! You'd be surprised how hard some of these suckers are to clean. 

The rubber bumper is made out of Kong material and is pretty durable as my dog does periodically just chew on it. I've seen larger unattended dogs somehow knock out the blue orb and do some damage to it. I recommend supervising your dog the first few times and show them how it works. The rubber ring makes it easy for dogs to pick up the toy and move it where they have more space.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">...the other loves.

https://www.chewy.com/omega-paw-tricky-treat-ball-dog-toy/dp/51233,Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball Dog Toy,"[<span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered this for my pups who both love enrichment games and toys. I was looking to add some variety to our collection, and liked that the Tricky Treat Ball wasn't so clunky or hard (noisy) like some of the other balls and wobblers. Unfortunately, most of the treats got stuck outside the dispensing tube, making it an incredibly frustrating toy for both me and my dogs. It's nearly impossible to clean the inside and it didn't stand up to regular wear and tear. After one session, it had gouges and scrapes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is not intended for heavy chewers but for dogs that need puzzles to challenge their mind. My shepherd/retriever mix needs fun challenges. Her activity level is higher than my other dog so I’m always looking for “puzzle toys”. I put about 10 Zukes mini training treats inside and it keeps her entertained while I eat breakfast. I keep it up out of her reach during the day so she knows it’s not for chewing up. She has other toys for chewing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is indeed tricky... There is one small hole where the treats fall out, what makes it particularly challenging is that the lip of the hole continues for about an inch and traps all the treats inside making it really difficult to actually get them out. Gizmo tries it for a little while and then gets frustrated and looks at me for help. I can't get the treats out either. Patience is not our virtue. Now we just spread gooey treats (like peanut butter) in the little craters on the surface of the ball instead. Way more fun and less frustration.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought a bunch of toys a couple weeks ago to give out slowly to my dogs. I gave this to my 15lb terrier mix with her breakfast food in it while I took a shower. Just in the 10 minutes I was in the shower she was able to chew through the side. Definitely do not recommend to any dogs that might be destructive. Unfortunately this was a total waste of money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this because Bailey is incredibly intelligent and loves the treat dispensing toys. I wanted something that didn't make the noise that hard plastic makes as she lifts it up and drops it on the floor.  Unfortunately, in less than ten minutes she chewed a hole in it. Chewy customer service was great when I called about it, but they replaced it with another one, which I can't use.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this after I was dog sitting and my client had this same exact toy for their pitbull. I bought it for my heeler and both balls have lasted a long time and are sturdy. I bough this months ago and it looks just as good as it did the day I got it. My only complaint is that the treats seem to come out too easy so I wish the hole was a little smaller but I will try using bigger treats and see if that helps.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a 60 lb pup who loves to play fetch, and is a power chewer. Have tried many toys and balls which ended up torn and trashed, but this one lasts! And it doubles up as a slow feeder (we trimmed the inside lip so treats come out a little easier; without doing that it was really difficult for even kibble to fall out). We got multiple so that should the day come where our current ball finally gets demolished, we have backups.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this because my dog needed something that would challenge her to get treats better than her Kong. Unfortunately the treats fall out easily just like the Kong. She never chews on her Kong but pretty much obliterates everything else including this Omega Paw treat ball. Lasted only minutes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a fun toy that I feed my dog a meal of kibble out of.  It is fun for him as it it rolls well and it is challenging as there hole has a large internal piece that catches the food so it doesn't just fall out easily it takes some rolling and sometimes shaking.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was rated to be for giant and large breeds, so I thought it would stand up to my half grown pittie. Within 5 minutes, he had chewed a hole in it. I definitely expected better for the price I paid.</span>]"

After a couple of hours, the outer shell, which is very soft, so no bouncing, is starting to tear.
The holes in the outer shell are large enough that a greyhound lower jaw can get caught inside, which doesn't look comfortable.

My corgi struggled to be able to squeak the ball on the inside so he ended up chewing the green ball apart until he got the yellow ball out. 
My heeler loved the ball and could squeak the yellow ball with no problem. BUT eventually my corgi chewed up both balls. Now all we have left are the yellow balls from the inside.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Normally, I love the Kong products. They are extremely durable, and allow my dogs some play time before they are able to destroy it.

However upon receipt of the item, the packaging specifically states ""Designed and Engineered in the U.S.A., Manufactured in China"".

Pretty orange with raised bumps which massages the dog's gums while he chews it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It does have a good bounce. Seems durable, but our dogs apparently have other favorites.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We were using this with dog food, but the hole is a bit too big for that. The treats we currently have on hand are too big, so we'll need to look for something else. It does have a wonky bounce because of all the bumps which seems to be interesting to the dogs. Once I find something that fits in it the right way, I'm sure they'll love it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My shepherd loves this ball. She is a 70lb puppy that’s teething, she is very gentle with things but she likes to chew. She has not torn it up. She likes the material, it’s like a thick softer plastic.

Ive had it for months now &amp; it hasn't broken, cracked, nothing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The size is great to easily take out of my German Shepard’s mouth. He loves the bouncy rubber and squeaker. Unfortunately, the rubber is not tough enough for his teeth and he was able to cut open a hole in the first week of having it. He is not allowed to chew his toys except bones and he managed to cut the rubber in an hour.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The nerf ball is their favorite toy. They love making it squeak and chasing after it. I would give it 5 stars if it were not for the fact that they manage to destroy the squeaker in a short time. They continue to play with it nonetheless.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I wish it were just a tad smaller for him to carry back to me (he has trouble getting his mouth around it) mind you he is a large dog, but it is still one of his favorites.  Not too heavy and of course, he loves the squeak.   Easy to throw, nice material and holds up well to his lab/pit jaw.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I just LOVE my ball. It’s easy to grab and chew. Mom throws it and I toss it around and chase it more. Sometimes I take it close to tease her, but I don’t let go. It’s red so Mom can find it easily.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">While our dog broke the squeaker within 10min, the toy itself is super strong! It’s nice that it doesn’t get slippery and you can get a good grip even with slobber all over!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was hoping/expecting better.  My 3 goldens were excited for some new squeaker balls.  30 minutes of play time and there were pieces missing and one already stopped squeaking!...Not worth the money!  I will not buy again and I do not recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Doberman loves this ball because it is easy to get a hold of in his mouth and it squeaks. He loves anything that squeaks!  It is a durable toy for large breed dogs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is esentially a ball within a ball. The interior ball is covered with a black felt-like fabric which he was able to tear away after a few uses causing the inner ball to crack open on its seam. The squeaker is gone. Would probably be just as fun for fetching if there was no inside ball. After removing the inner damaged ball, I gave it 1 star because toy is still useable for fetch but I do not recommend it and will not buy it again.</span>]"

My only down side for this ball, is the slit /handle for them to grab. It makes for more fun and makes them think to have turn the ball a certain way to pick it up.

It’s a great size for him to chase, carry and herd and it still has a good bounce despite the two “grab” holes.

When he does it though it usually slips out of his mouth and he tries to catch it with his paws when it does since it’s so bouncy. Due to that it also keeps him entertained by himself.

Puppy is 50 lbs now (5 months old) and actively tries to destroy this toy to get the treat out daily. He has not damaged it at all. For being so durable, it doesn't FEEL tough.

I am using it for my five month old labradoodle who loves to fetch. However, I am concerned that in order to squeak this ball, which she really enjoys on the return, that she may develop tendonitis in her jaw! Just kidding but not really.

Because it's a stuffy, I know it's not indestructible.

Not just that, but all of the squeakers are still intact and working. Our dogs do love to tear up plush toys, but it’s pretty clear when they’ve gone from jovial, playful tug time to “must kill this toy now” mode, so I just monitor things and take it away when one of them starts trying to chew it up.

Having it less than 5 days, he has been able to chew off chunks of the outer ball (hard plastic). Definitely not something I would recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Had several of these for our 4 babies.  We ended up at the emergency vet because it became lodged on our boys lower jaw.  If the ball was made of a plyable material this would not be an issue.  But because the outer ball is hard as a rock once your dog gets their lower jaw in so far there is no coming out of it safely.  We threw every one of these away!  Never will we have a hard plastic ball with mouthing holes or the temptation to get inside again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs are obsessed with everything jolly ball makes (except for the egg - they hate those). They can be hard to find as they always seem to be out of stock. Glad I snagged another one!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog will NOT play with this ball. It's hard plastic so he can't bit down on it, hold it in his mouth and run. He's a German Shepherd so he's not a small dog.</span>]"

She is a service dog who is always working and wanted her to have a bit of down time.

The pink shows up better on the grass than the orange or green balls.

It’s fabric over a thin plastic inside. I was surprised that it was as thin a plastic inside as it was. Our dog crushed it while squeaking it but surprisingly it pops back up really well. It has continued to pop up anytime he’s played with it. He has a favorite ball and so this one isn’t played with a ton. If it was the only one he had to lay with it would have been destroyed already. He’d have bitten through the plastic if we weren’t playing fetch. I like to try different ones so he gets different stimulation. His favorite ball doesn’t squeak. So I tried this one for something different. And he played with it for several days then went back to his favorite ball. </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves it!! At first it was hard for him to hold it in his mouth which made it a game for him because he would hit it with his paws and chase the ball around.

I don't think this is meant to be a chew toy, so I don't understand the bad reviews...
It's a ball not a aggressive chewier toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">To be honest, I bought this for my niece who is a big Jack Skellington fan.   I don't think it would last long if I gave it to the dogs to play with.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy broke after 2 days of my dog playing fetch with it. He loved it at first, so for the price it was fine. It might be more suitable for smaller dogs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Fell apart in less than 5 minutes. Very disappointing.
If your have a dog who doesn’t get physical with a toy than I guess it would be ok.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I had such high expectations based on the description. It was very misleading. The ball is tiny, smaller than my fist. My 80 pound dog crushed the indestructible squeaker (the whole ball, actually) during our first game of fetch. I let him chew on it until the outer layer started to come off. We had a solid 10 seconds of fetch and four minutes overall. Not a worth while toy. Try your luck elsewhere.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">What a bad toy. Odd shape weird covering, no fun for my small dog or his medium size friend.

Although not her fav, she still spends a good amount of time entertaining herself with this football.  It's easy to grab so she can toss it around.  It's smushy so she can chew on it without it breaking.  This is a definite plus because my little girl is an aggressive chewer</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Love chuck it and especially the breathe right toys!

And  when I opened the box i found that the battery activation device was missing from the ball/package. That means the ball was active during shipping using up battery.The other ball in the box had the plastic activation device in place.  I have had many of these and it is not easy to change battery. But my boxer loves them</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My terrier may be small but toys don't last long with him, sometimes breaking the same day he gets it.  This babble ball lasted a month which is a long time for my Champ! I'm getting another but trying a larger size.

Buyer Beware!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Ok, so it definitely is fun and made the whole family laugh. Our dog loves it and since we posted online her playing with it all my friends are buying one. 
My only problem with it might just be, a my dog issue. Our little girl is a bichon/shih mix and I feel if I not watching she could break it in half very easy. So I  did order the wobble ball much bigger so she could play with that. We will really supervise her with this toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I believe we have Four Babble Balls now and love every one! My Border Collie goes crazy over them. We bought two of the

We got the large andwe sliced an X that goes about 1/3 down and have someone hold the X open and put in a Babble Ball. The X closes back up nicely because it real hard to open. Because the Babble Ball is hard plastic and bangs on the floor and has a battery in it, by putting it in that rubber ball it cushions it. The Starmark chew balls are chew proof! I got my first when my Border Collie Bandit was teething, He still plays with it........it is indestructible I think. The Babble Balls are , I just can't say enough good about</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this ball about 2-3 weeks ago and my dog goes crazy over it! It’s definitely noisy, but it it keeps her entertained when I give it to her. She’ll run all over the house tossing it and chasing it. Same with the backyard when we’re out there. I DONT leave it out all day or when I’m gone due to it being plastic and having a battery in it. She’s a 75lb Pitbull and would anyone with sense knows that ball would be be gone or in pieces. But it’s definitely a good buy for fetch, some indoor entertainment while you’re around and rainy days. I’ll be purchasing a backup, along with the wobble ball she loves. 
But also one not to leave out with an unattended dog all day.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My puppy was scared of this toy at first since it makes a lot of loud animal noises but now she loves it and chases it around all over the place. I really like this toy except I wish it had an on/off button. I recommend this toy if you have carpet but not on wood, tile, laminate or any other type of hard floor since it is made of hard plastic so it sounds like it is going to break when she plays with it on those surfaces.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Good news is that my puppy loves it. I don’t mind the animal noises, but definitely would not recommend using it on a hard surface. Extremely noisy!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Got a size small for my 2 rescue girls (11 lb BT puppy and a 40 lb pittie). They both loved it immediately. They were running from it and chasing it non stop for an entire afternoon. Its been 4 hours and they are still playing with it. 

The entire ball is hard plastic, so if you have a power chewer, not sure how well it would hold up. I intend to purchase the large size for my pittie since she likes the sounds. She is a power chewer so i already know that i will not leave the toy unattended in case she cracks it in half and tries to eat it. But it def keeps her busy.</span>]"

They absolutely love it. It's nice and light, too. It's actually a fantastic weight for multiple throws and retrieves, regarding any fatigue factor. GSDs have an endless amount of energy, but it allows for the smaller puppies to play, too.

We don't leave it out for them to chew on, so I can't attest to the durability in that type of situation; however, for throw and retrieve activities it is a perfect ball - and the price is a sweet bonus.

I highly recommend this ball.

Like on everything she can reach!! I was skeptical of this ball because it was not a solid ball; it has some squish to it. Buuttttt it is amazing!! She LOVES this ball! It does have some teeth marks, but it has lasted for almost a month now with no pieces missing thus far!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My one year old Brittany mix loves to catch balls, but he is also a crazy chewer.  I needed a ball that was soft enough to throw in the house, but strong enough to hold up to his teeth.  This ball is perfect. I had my doubts because it feels so soft and light, but after a few weeks of regular play, there aren't even any teeth marks on it.  I don't leave it laying around for him, it just comes out for supervised play time. But he will run off with it and chomp for a bit, and no harm done.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Out of several toys I bought on my last order, this one is the only one that survived.

I don't have to buy 5 at a time anymore.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a super chewer (70 lb border collie/Aussie/pit mix). He hates hard balls - which most of them are when designated for super chewers. He likes to mouth this one and catch it.  Yes, this ball shows teeth marks and has a few small pieces missing but it has lasted months and is his favorite. Gets dropped on my lap daily to initiate play. Great for indoors- lightweight. Even our other dog that has never been a ball fan will grab this one to play with.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball is still around.

Definitely recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I thought this would be a  good toy for our lab but it wasn't.  It's not braided well and fell apart quickly. Tennis ball chewed up quickly. Our dog doesn't destroy toys quickly but not the case here. Poor quality!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog chewed the tennis ball off in 1 hr the rope is good it was a good idea but if your dog is a big cheer at all the tennis ball will be gone quick</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bouncy, fun and easy for your dog to see flying through the air or bouncing on the ground. Multiple textures are good.  This toy is a favorite!</span>]"

A hole developed that quickly and then she began eating bits of it as she chewed away so we tossed it out.  Not worth the money.  Artemis vomited little bits of plastic and this is HARD plastic, so it's not going gentle into her intestines if she didn't toss it all up!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">For such a simple toy, it is quite entertaining!  My 55 lb dog loves jumping at it with  his feet and trying to catch it as it moves quite unpredictably.  It is a very hard plastic so, in my opinion, is a better outdoor toy as it really crashes loudly into walls and furniture.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pitbull LOVES the jolly egg. She goes crazy if she sees any ball but now that I’ve gotten her this she doesn’t care about anything else. It tired her out because she can’t grip it. Would definitely recommend it if you have a dog that tears up every ball you get</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">my pup played with it for little while and now he not interested in it any more. now if it squeaked he would love it but that my puppy:)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have been buying jolly balls for years for our puls. Maybe it was ignorance in my part but I expected these to be egg shaped jolly balls. They might say jolly ball but they are just straight hard plastic, not the usual rubbery plastic. My dogs couldn't play with them and eventually just let them sit on the side of the yard which they never do with even the most boring of toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">my year old Golden Retriever spends hours playing with this toy all over the backyard! I didn't know/think it would be that big of a hit.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Samoyed loves this egg. He has so much fun trying to catch, chase and pounce this buoyantly fun toy. This is great for indoor (on a rug) or outdoor play. The egg is made out of hard plastic. My pup is about 50lbs and cannot get his teeth into this toy. We haven’t had it long but it seems durable.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was not what we were expecting. We had bought a ball that our dogs love it is sturdy rubber but they can still pick it up. This egg is hard plastic and my dogs can’t get it in their mouth. We have two labs, maybe a better toy for larger dogs?</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My GSD had a scare with this egg. She punctured it and also managed to chew through and before we realized how much she'd chewed through, she got her lower jaw stuck in it! Luckily she's not hurt and the Egg is in the trash!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I really enjoy the Jolly Pets toy line as the balls are some of the few toys my Border Collie/ Australian Cattle Dog mix doesn't destroy. I was hoping the egg would hold his interest as he likes to chase things like balls and flirt poles. He loves it! He can't get his mouth around it so he can't destroy it and the shape makes it skitter erratically which he loves. I will sometimes put it in his crate if I have to run a quick errand and he will happily chase it around the crate. It is hard plastic so it rather loud on wood floors and against the crate, but I don't mind. A very large dog could puncture this toy if you choose a small enough one that they can pick up. I have not had this problem </span>]"

We have a couple of slightly uneven spots in our yard and that adds to the movement excitement when she tried to pin down the egg. Even though she has a tough time “catching” the egg, the chase keeps her very interested in play.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 1.5 year old Great Dane loves toys. I have heard such good things about Jolly toys and that they are also super durable so I thought we would try this one out. He could care less about it. I don't think he even realizes it is a toy. I think it is much too hard for him, it feels like thick plastic and he can't even fit his big mouth around it to carry it around. Overall I do not recommend this toy unless your dog wants to push things around with his nose or something.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Great for throwing but not chewing. My fur baby doesn’t care about this toy unless I throw it but then she won’t even attempt to pick it up or touch it after she follows it to it’s resting place. Doesn’t keep her attention since it’s hard plastic.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I absolutely adore this toy. I can throw it in the yard and my dog will go crazy over it until he tires out, it's the best! It's meant to be large so they can't grab it in their mouths and destroy it, which is the best part. he chases it all over the yard and pushes it around and it's so fun to watch.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I had no idea how my border collie was going to feel about the Jolly Egg but went ahead and got it. Turns out he’s OBSESSED. The best part is, it keeps him happily occupied which means I don’t have to be on call for endless fetch sessions.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is not made of the same material as the jolly balls.  It is a hard plastic.   My dogs ignore it.  My guys chew the handles off the jolly balls so I thought this might be a good alternative.   Instead it was a total waste of money.  It's too big to pick up in their mouth and doesn't squish.  Very disappointed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pup Jem chases this thing all over the yard pushing it with her nose - so funny to watch.  Hard plastic but she’s a Lab and can pick it up to carry it.  The small end of the egg has some chew marks from her but it’s still intact and she’s had it for over a month that’s pretty good.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Seems like a quality product, but my dog just isn’t into it. She will chase it if I push it, but she doesn’t actively engage with it at all. I will be regifting it most likely as it was bigger than I thought. Maybe slightly larger than a football.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My power chewer LOVED this toy. It was just big enough that it was too hard to get a good grip on it with his mouth, so it ""squirted"" out of his mouth and he chased it all over the yard.
Unfortunately after a year or so he was able to make a few small dents in it, and eventually did destroy it when we weren't watching. But that's a SUPER success in our book.
We'll be buying a replacement for sure.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Dane just looks at it and walks away. She loves toys. I threw it for her and she looks at me as if to ask, “ Now what? “</span>]"

However after much play they wore down the handle and it was hanging so I cut it off to prevent my dogs or the neighbors dog from choking.  However four of these dogs won’t play with this ball no matter how hard I try. My neighbors dog is a lab and refuses to touch it. My Yorkie used to love chasing it playing socca with him and grabbing the handle.   I noticed the ball was made with a new rubber material not like the older one I had.  So now no dog will play with it.  Are there any other balls made like the jolly tuss and play ball with the older rubber plastic type material. ?  If so I would very much like to try </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought two of these, one for each dog.  Unfortunately I have an aggressive chewer, so while this was really fun for my gentle chewing German Shepherd, my black lab healer mix chewed the handle off immediately.  So if anyone has a dog that really enjoys chomping on their toys, be careful and always watch your dogs during play time with toys and/or hard treats.  I do recommend this toy but again NOT for aggressive chewers &amp; please always watch your fur babies while they play or eat.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Not worth the $22... We were excited for our six month old Dane mix to get this toy. Within a half hour he ripped the handle in pieces. Luckily he was being supervised and we pulled the remains out of his mouth! Very disappointed in the quality.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This huge ball is a hit with my pup! It's almost soccer ball sized so I kick it around for him but he also plays by himself. He can't bite the ball, just the handle so he runs around pushing it with his mouth. He loves this toy!
So far, the handle has lots of bite marks and I imagine he will be able to destroy it eventually but it keeps his attention and he wags his tail tons while playing with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our son has a new rescue dog and I sent this as a gift!  I watched the video of Corn(the new grand pup) begin to play with this toy, loving it, and then within 4 and a half minutes he had torn the handle off!!  Not a tough or strong ball at all!  I was very disappointed, to say the least.  This product did not meet my satisfaction and did not meet the description of what a great ball for tough chewers as stated on your website!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered this toy for my dog and it has quickly become his new favorite! He absolutely loves playing fetch with this ball. The handle makes it easy for him to carry. He has punctured the ball in a few places but its still holding up well. I do put it away after we play so that he doesn't chew it up.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 70# Pitt mix loooooved this!!! About two minutes after he opened it, he discovered he could use it as a wrecking ball on all the shelves. Definitely an out door toy, instant favorite!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is probably one of the best dog toys in existence. Our border collie LOVES the handle and the weight helps to tire her out a bit. Ball is life, so we play with her jollyballs (this and the rope one) multiple times every single day.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog destroyed this within minutes - chewed the handle right off. Will still play with the ball a bit but this toy did not stay intact long. This toy may be better suited for a dog who isn't much of a chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have been very happy with Jolly Ball toys in the past but obviously this one was not made from the same high quality material. In just a week, this one has caved in and will not return to its original shape. About ready for the trash!  Very disappointed!</span>]"

She is a chewing machine.  We've gotten toys that were for serious chewers that didn't last an hour.  This Nerf dog ball has lasted for well over a year.  She loves it. She will throw it, watch it roll and light up, chase after it, grab it, bounce it and throw it again.  She entertains herself in ways I've never seen a dog do before.  When we pretend we're going to go grab it, she races to get it first. This is a keeper.  We've got three now for those times she loses it somewhere and it takes a while to find.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered this item for our dog to play with in our large backyard at night since it’s not well lit.  I thought it’d make it easier for him to find it in the dark.  The first ball I received did not light up at all, so I contacted Chewy and they sent a replacement.  The second ball I received lit up for literally one bounce and that was it.  It’s a decent enough ball, but that’s it.  It doesn’t do anything other than be a ball and for the price I’d rather buy, and my dog would rather play with, a kong tennis ball or something else.  Do not recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pit bull put this ball through the ringer. He absolutely loved it right off the bat - the lights unfortunately didn't last more than two days. But the ball itself still is intact after over a month of him playing with it regularly, and he is NOT easy on toys! It's stood up to the abuse better than other toys that were specifically made to be durable. Even though the light-up function didn't last long, I still really recommend this ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball is great for an adult sized dog.  A tennis ball is about 2.5 to 2.6 inches in diameter.

I've bought quite a few, so I'll be posting a bunch of reviews.
The squeaker lasted literally 3 minutes. Literally.
The ball itself was damaged in about 20 minutes. 
The ball broke along the seams (like a tennis ball). When this happens, my dog's lower jaw can get stuck inside the ball, and she panics. I am not fond of this.
Two stars because she really loved it for the short time she had it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pup loved this ball but unfortunately, it only lasted a week.  He likes to chomp down to make it squeak and it ended up coming apart and we had to throw it away.  I would suggest this ball for pups that don't have a strong jaw grip.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My big golden loves squeaks but he chomps them so hard that the squeak goes pretty quick.  The only way I can make this squeak is to stand on it on a hard floor but he gives one chomp and it squeaks for him very satisfactorily.  He has chomped on it a lot but it's still in one piece, too, full of very many more squeaks.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my golden retriever's new favorite ball!  Very durable, good quality, &amp; cool bounce to it!  I ordered another one, as well as a smaller size for the golden puppy we are getting next month.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Don't know what happened here, but after a day or two our dog showed no more interest. It is somewhat difficult to make it squeak, and that might be the problem.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I nicknamed my dog Jeter as he would play catch all day.  He catches 99% — even if the throw is a bit off.  This ball is soft but firm so I don’t have to be concerned with break his teeth, the texture helps me feel it’s not likely to slide down his throat, and he likes to squeak retrieving for another throw.  We both love this ball!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball lasted less than five minutes, we did not even get to throw it.  My little Pug/Chiwawa was so excited to get a new ball, he ran around the house non-stop for 3-4 minutes with it in his mouth and then when he dropped it for a throw, the part where the squeaker is was caved in, almost severed completely around the whole fault line in the seam.  If I could give minus 5 I would.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Shepard broke the squeaker on the first day. Then she proceded to bite into it st the seam so there is now a huge hole. 3 stars because it still bounces and she still likes it!

So far it has seemed pretty sturdy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Cocker Spaniel loves this toy. He likes the way it bounces funny and it stands up to his chewing.

One of her favorite toys. So far it is still in great shape.

She loves to play fetch with it for hours and hours, literally every single day.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dogs tear-through toys, but this one has stood-up thus far - likely because it's not primarily a chew toy. One of our boys is obsessed with balls, and this Megalast ball version was a hit. Ours is bright green.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I've got a 114-pound Great Dane ""puppy"" and a Pittie mix that work these over pretty well...and not just for toss time--they CHEW them!  It's one of the few toys and chews that offer durability for my two jaw-blessed girls.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have an extreme chewer (German shepard mix) and a young puppy (St. Bernard). I bought 2 toys to try out the first time. I have had em for over a month now! Still in 1 piece! I recently bought 2 more for the back yard!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I honestly bought this ball because I needed to spend a few more dollars for free shipping and my dogs, like most, love a good ball.  This one is really durable.  Small treats fit inside to keep the pooches busy while I'm trying to work.  My larger dog (lab/GSD mix) can get the treats pretty quickly but my smaller, 40ish pound, mix has a softer mouth and can't get the treat near the center. Good weight for a nice throw. The bounce is unpredictable so we only throw the ball outside.  I may try to put some wet dog food in the center then freeze it for a summertime snack.  I think the ball would hold up even after that.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These are the best balls I've purchased &amp; I've purchased lots of balls! They bounce well. They don't break apart from all the chewing my dog does. I've gotten both the medium and large, both are great!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my second purchase because the first one often gets lost. My German Shepherd can chew anything to pieces in less than 5 minutes, but this? Not! It has lasted several years and is still going strong. It is as good as a Kong, and since it is all slobbery, it’s easier to throw.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Lasts and stands up to our chewer. Love that it is not a squeak toy. Our boy entertain himself</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Unfortunately it is no longer made in USA   
I only give my dog products I can trust   
I try to buy only USA made products</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I didn't pay for this ball because it was given to me, yet I would honestly buy another if this one is ever put to pasture because it is extremely durable and bouncy!! We've had ours about six months and it's yet to crack or dull in the sun nor become too boring for the dogs to play with. Would definitely recommend!!</span>]"

The puppy does not kill the ball nor does she steal balls from the other two.  These balls last!!!!!!
I picked up this orange one (same manufacturer) because the blue ones were NIS - I needed a play date ball.   This one is even better because the orange color stands out in the deep grass. 
I LOVE the Tough Line of products; their items last!!!! - for my son’s Pit mix and all of my Labs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I'm sure this product would be great for most dog breeds.

It doesn’t really bounce, just loudly thuds on the ground a few times- definitely not high bounces you expect when you hear the word bounce.

Nothing  makes her happier than when we throw this for her...it bounces unpredictably and she loves to grab it on the rebound, retrieve and return it. Very durable.

Happy pup, Happy humans!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I would consider our pup a light to moderate chewer, definitely not overly aggressive by any means. Because of the treat holes, and the flimsy-ness is the material, this toy did not last more than 2-3 hours.

It is a nice size &amp; easier than other balls for her to grab &amp; carry. She's had all different kinds &amp; colors over the years &amp; this one looks the most like a true football too!

The small size is perfect for our Havanese to grab in their mouths and squeak on their own. This is a big hit. Hoping both the squeaks and lights last a long time.

And yes, they are very loud so, if you have a timid or shy dog, you might want to opt for the ball with the blinking lights instead.  I have this one as well and my dog will fetch it till the cows come home but not the one with the exceptionally loud noises emanating from it.  I actually love all of the animal sounds that this ball can make and find it most amusing but I cannot say the same for my dog.  Maybe the manufacturer can tweak the sound to make is a little less loud.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">At first my dog, a chocolate lab, was apprehensive of the new toy especially all the sounds. After about 20 minutes of inspecting it and listening to it, she picked it up. She loves it. She carries it around. It is sturdy, makes sounds when rolling on ground or shake it. Fun toy for her.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Pumpkin my blind Yorkie just loves this noisy toy. She zeros in on it in now time. It took about 15 minutes to quit barking and attacking it, before she accepted it. Now it is the only thing she plays with. I bought a couple of the balls that is in the middle of the tires with plans to insert them in some of the soft toys she has but won’t play with because if you throw it it takes a while before she can find it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the second one of these. He chewed through the first one in about 8 months after daily play &amp; chew. He uses it to play soccer then chewing it. He loves the sounds. Unfortunately the 2nd one did not last as long. Wish it was made with the quality of a Kong tire. Then it would be AWESOME. Great idea needs more quality of material.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a pit bull and he loves the noise that this toy makes but he destroyed it within 5 minutes!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Looks sturdy—black part is heavy tire like material. Even though I like the sounds that are emitted when moved, my pup does not. The sounds actually startle him. He does not like it and for the price, sending it back.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The tires on the outside weren't a rubber like I expected. Destroyed within 10mins. It was cute though. Wish Kong made something like this, then it would definitely be near indestructible</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a dog that is not a heavy chewer, his toys generally last months and some have lasted years.  He played with this, and within a few minutes had chewed the ball out of the tire.  I get that dogs destroy things, but the fact that he destroyed this so quickly and is not even generally a dog that destroys toys  is disappointing.</span>]"

Note; this does not contain a squeaker</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy arrived and I read the tag affixed to it (and you are advised to have them tags and such loops removed) , Tags essentially read that it should not be used as a chew toy and you must monitor your pet when in use. It does not have a squeaker :-(   our English Mastiff  Ms. Fortune seems to like those squeakers (the ones she doesn't destroy immediately)  We'll see if she takes to this toy. It has a hard front ball and the larger ball is like a rubber ball. It has no loop to allow us to use it without getting slobber on us but the strips are helpful. This is actually larger than I had expected so harder to get lost and under furniture.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is the only one my German Shepherd has not destroyed..plus the squeak lasts a very long time. He chews on it, tosses it around and nudges me (or our other dog) to grab the toy’s ‘legs’ to play tug. If he leaves it outside, he will bark to go out if only to retrieve his Wubba and bring it inside. (Yes, we call it Wubba (toys and balls are other objects.)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this for my Sheppard Brady. He loves it but I should have gotten large not mega, it is extra large and very heavy-duty he loves dragging it around. He's already stolen it to play outside with. Highly recommend but next time I'll get a large even though he's a big dog.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was a replacement for the wubba I bought as a Christmas present. Lasted until mid April. Which is longer than anything else of that type lasted. I only wish the mega weber had a squeaky center ball like the next size down does is my buddy likes The squeakers. Well worth the money though</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a 7 MO lab. After one day the ball in the top went flat and in less than a week, one of the “legs” came off and there was a two or three inch hole in the top. The dog loves it, but I think we will have to toss after 2 weeks. Not worth it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My baby went NUTS for this. She loves regular Wubbas, so I knew I had to try out the mega version. She loved it and has been playing with it since we got it. It doesn’t squeak like a smaller Wubba, but she loves to whip it around and bite into the middle part. Just ordered another!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’ve been cooped up with my English Bulldog for a month (not complaining) and decided he needed to have a new distraction.

She loves to grab the ""tentacles"" of the  toy and bash it around back and forth. This toy's size is HUGE! I love this toy for her!

For this, the ones listed at 19mm long are the right size. Weirdly enough, the replacement squeakers often last longer than the original.

He was very upset when I trashed it.  I bought him other balls, but he didn't like any of them as well.  I finally ordered this one from Chewy again.  When I opened the box, he got so excited when he saw it again.  He has to have it every day when he goes out.  We ordered an extra, and we always bring it in with him now.

We had seen someone at a dog park with a green one that the owner had for a few years. 
He absolutely loved it as it squeaks and is fun to retrieve! Unfortunately, less than an hour of playing with it, Bailey started pulling off the ""laces"" of the ball and there were holes in it.

Came back looking for hyper pet's K9 Kannon. Chewy only had this one. Harsh recoil from a metal spring instead of silicone band and balls do not have the same velocity as Hyperpet.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So, I bought this before I saw the bad reviews. I figured oh well whats the harm i already paid. 
Just a disclaimer too, we have two of the nerf brand ball shooters as well.
       For anyone looking for a ball shooter, I recommend the nerf gun brand in blue and orange. Those I got on sale a few yrs ago and it's truly worth it. I decided on a new one because we left our nerf ones outside in the rain amd sun and it doesnt shoot as smoothly now, but still way better than this product. 

I'm angry at this ball shooter, but the plastic is cheap, you can tell when you open it. The handle you pull back is cheaply made, I dont expect it to last long. The ball shoots fine for a backyard and my dog</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Purchased this item to launch tennis balls for my Labrador, further then what this 63 old could throw them. This item doesn't send the balls are far as I either hoped or anticipated it would. On the plus it does save my arm when using it. Will continue shopping at Chewy because I have had good experiences before.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Doesn't shoot more than maybe 40 ft. My dog looks at me as if to say seriously. Buy a chuck it cause this is useless.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This launcher does not launch the ball far at all. It only went about 15 feet. Would not recommend for a big dog.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs LOVED this toy but I recieved it less than a month ago and the black pull back trigger has broken on this toy. I noticed it says 1 year warranty on the website. Wanting to get the toy replaced.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This item was not what I read about before I purchased, did not live up to expectations. It doesn’t launch the ball very far, I can throw further!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The very first day the trigger broke,  I should have read the reviews. Amazon was great about the return with immediate attention. They told me to keep, donate or throw away. I opened it, with 20+ screws holding the gun together you'd think it would be better quality, basically the black plastic parts are very brittle plastic and breaks quickly &amp; easily. I'm trying to fix the very small parts with krazy glue.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This blaster started out great! My Doxie loved it.  It just gave out so easily.  After like 50 launches it broke.  :(</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It worked but my dog was afraid of it because when you short it it makes a loud noise which disturbs my dog and now he is afraid of it I’m back to throwing as usual this just sites in the garage collecting dust</span>]"

Finally, he has a toy that is worth the money because it lasts!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the greatest ball that I have ever bought thus far for my pit bulls.

However, here we are over a week later and that is all there are, small teeth marks that have not gotten any bigger. He absolutely loves balls so for us this is a great choice, because a tennis ball is destroyed in minutes. It is heavy so can’t play catch with it, I am afraid he will get hurt. In the house we roll it. Good to add to our new collection of tough balls. Thanks for a great ball!!</span>]"

The Zogoflex Air Boz Ball by West Paw is not only our dog's favorite, but ours. We have a big boy chocolate lab that loves to swim. These balls not only float but do a dancing bounce around when thrown for fetching so offers up even more fun and excercise when your dog goes to retrieve. Equally important, the Zogoflex is great very the strongest chewers- he has not put a dent in the balls yet have some ""softness"" to the touch. West Paw toys are made in the USA so that is very reassuring in regard to safety. We have several other toys from West Paw and all are as described on their website.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have yet to find a ball that could my rescue lab mix pup couldn’t destroy in less than 3 minutes! It was getting expensive.. &amp; I worried about the toxicity! This ball gives him great satisfaction, is nontoxic, floats when he drops it in the pond, never shows the wear &amp; he doesn’t want to put it down! Great product! Thank you!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was concerned that this was a foam toy that my dog would pick apart but he hasn't.   He likes this ball and so do we.  It's easy to see with the color and we like how it stays cleaner than a tennis ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a chewer and he LOVES his ball. He plays with it daily. Its very tough and durable. Great ball for bigger dogs!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Can’t say enough about the West Paw Zogoflex  ball; it’s my Chesador’s FAVORITE toy! The ‘small’ is the size of a standard tennis ball, able to use it with a ‘Chuck it’. He’s known for destroy balls in under 10 seconds. However these have stayed intact since day one. They are made of a compact foam that are completely resilient. Thank you for such a FABULOUS product!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered this for my mini rat terrier.

He destroys Everything except the extra large black kongs.

Finally a ball she likes but cannot destroy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So hard to find dog toys made in USA. One of our dogs always has a ball in her mouth.

Do NOT waste your money with Ethical Pet!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I thought I had found the perfect gift for a friend who has two very large labradors. The only problem is the balls are made in China. I gave her the option of accepting them or not and she decided not to. It’s really too bad I didn’t notice this when I ordered them. Otherwise, they appear to be perfect, really strong, and bouncy.

If your dog is a hard and regular chewer with a scissor-bite type of jaw, they might be able to bite/cut into this ball a bit more than you may like. But for my Bulldogs, this is a ball that they can not easily rip into pieces, become overly stimulated with unnecessary noise-making inserts, and has an opening through the middle so they can freely breathe and hold onto it when running around the yard with it in their mouths.

This ball and this ball only has been my dogs favorite toy since she was 6 months old. Its virtually indestructible. She could chew through anything but not this. We have about 10 of these balls total, because sometimes she leaves them out in the yard (and we always need at least one in the house for her at all times). One ball was buried in the ground for so long, a root started to grow through it, and it still wasn't damaged enough to throw away. Anyways, great ball.

The second my dog went to pick it up, the rope fell out.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I've bought this particular toy for my tug-o-war lovin' dogs many times and it's usually held up pretty well considering the energy my one particular dog puts into trying to destroy it. Unfortunately, just a day after a bought a new one, the dogs were playing tug-o-war and the rope pulled out because the knot was not big enough. Now I'm left with a ball that is incredibly hard to play with and a rope that the dogs have minimal interest in. This has happened before but not so shortly after receiving it! Why can't they make the knots a little more substantial so that this doesn't happen? I've tried to shove it back through but it's very difficult and it's near impossible to undo and then re-do </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My girl loves rhe Romp n Roll but only wants the 4.5 size.

She loves regular Jolly Balls, but after a couple of weeks of play would rip the handles off of them from swinging them around. This version of the toy is great in that it has a rope through it that she can use to swing the ball around instead of an attached handle that can break off. The ball itself is much more rigid than a straight Jolly Ball, and feels a little heavier, but that doesn't stop her from whipping it around. Highly recommend for larger, strong dogs who like a good game of tug or for dogs who like to roughhouse with big toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have an ACD that loves to destroy toys.  This toy is definitely his favorite.  Thank goodness it can withstand his chewing and he grabs the rope to sling it back and forth.  I have to reinforce the knots or with his play he will pull the rope through the ball.  He will retrieve it all day just to have it thrown or kicked just so he can chase it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 9 month old English Mastiff has torn apart every toy including his three Kong toys.  I have used larger Jolly Balls for my horses, so I decided to purchase one for Henry.  He loves it!  It has proven to be indestructible.

It stays outside as it is larger. He loves to run with it and swing it around. It's very entertaining for him. We purchased the purple one and it stays indoors. It's the perfect size and he loves it as much as the red one. It does not deflate even with tiny puncture holes and the rope has held up incredibly well. Would purchase either again.</span>]"

Squeakers are his favorite but he has a habit of surgically removing them from toys in the first few minutes. Since there isn't one small squeaker to root around for the ball has had significant longevity over other toys. Be warned the squeak is more of a discordant screech but the dog loves it so I'll be smiling as my ears bleed.

Bigger than a softball, smaller than a basketball, so probably better for med to large dogs. We like this toy for indoor play. When the weather isn't cooperating, we can roll this big, fun ball down the hall and our dog will do this thousands of times and never get bored. The outside is a soft fleece that has held up extremely well to how much we play. The ball itself is a giant squeak-ball, so also fun to squeak and throw for added excitement.

Its literally moving around between the ball and the material. He's the Herry Houdini of squeaky killing. Just got it today and within an hour, he killed it. Within the first few minutes the ball would collapse and slowly inflate back up.  Right where my finger is is where the squeaker piece isn't longer in the ball. Hes not even chewing the ball hes just playing with it. Hes a total nut ball. I thought it might work because the ball is bigger than his head.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">only made it for 2 play sessions.

He loves this big ball and can get his huge mouth around it to make it squeak! Sister Honey, AKA Destructor of Toys, can’t get her mouth around it to tear it up. I hear it squeaking several times a day. Now, it IS big, so it isn’t suitable for smaller dogs. Diogi is a 83 pound boxer/something-very-big mix.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have an large Aussie puppy (75 pounds) who is a chewer. This ball entertains him (he loves to make it squeak), and so far, it's holding up very well to him chasing and grabbing it with his teeth. It's a heavy ball, with a harder surface under the tough cloth, which probably makes it more durable. Glad I bought this one!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves these balls. I’ve had three. He inevitably tears them apart as he does all toys. They are a nemesis to be destroyed. But they last as long as any with him. He’s so ridiculously happy with these. Why? It is very easy to bite and it is very very easy to squeak. The squeaking will drive you crazy. But his face and obvious enchantment with this overrides that. I guess I was obnoxious as a kid as well. Buy it.</span>]"

Seems like a nice quality ball (none of them destroyed it yet) &amp; it does smell like mint.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this ball based off of its name as a ""tough dog chew toy"". When I got it, I was a bit put out by two ugly mistakes in the silicone. They looked like they would be weak spots that my pup, Newt, could pick off. But to my surprise, this ball holds up! Newt loves chomping on it, and throwing it around and scratching at it. It is the perfect size and texture, and has quickly become his favorite toy. I love that I can put his kibble inside to make for extra interesting play time</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Harper liked this ball a lot. She’s had other orbee products such as bones and balls. The funny thing was about this one I got some pictures of her with it saying happy birthday and after awhile the happy birthday chipped right off so it was only a birthday ball for a few hours which was perfectly fine to me now that it isn’t her birthday anymore :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was exciting to buy my dog this ball for her first birthday! After receiving the package I was definitely let down, the whole point was to showcase the Happy Birthday but the two P’s were rubbed off defeating the purpose. The ball also came kind of dirty with brown specs on the ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have 2 pit bulls and both are super chewers! This is the first and only ball that has lasted months! We love this ball so much that we’ve bought 2 and plan to buy more. My dogs love how bouncy it is, and often will bounce it themselves around the house. The lettering did wear off right away but my dogs could care less. We are just glad it held up!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Fia likes chasing her new ball but it is smaller then I expected so it gets lost under furniture. Also the Happy Birthday wore off the first day. Not a $10 ball in my opinion but maybe I will find it holds up awhile as we have only had it a little over a week.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Ball is just a little too big for my little dog. She is actually afraid of it and barks st it. 
Still is fun to see her react to it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Chase is the happiest 2 yr old!  My coworker suggested I get this for him.  Its great, has great bounce and most of it has not been destroyed, yet!  From what I hear, its indestructible!  We will see!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">What a nice little ball! A perfect size for fetch, running and playing with other pups.
A tuff “foam” that the dogs don’t seem to want to chew to pieces; even tho they certainly could; I think they like playing with her too much.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this for our pups 5th birthday.

They still tear them apart, but it takes months not days.  I purchased the Strobe ball just for fun along with a squeak one.  The dogs were curious with the strobe in the dark, but as hard as they are on toys, the strobe only lasted a few days.  The ball is still in good shape to play, just doesn't light up any more.  For dogs that are not hard chewers, the light would probably last longer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Not sure that my dogs were impressed by the strobe affect or the bounce but the neighbor dog seemed to like the lights.  Too bad the strobe lasted less than 3 hours of play.  Put it away while still working but pulled it out today and dead.   It's a great concept but they need to come up with something that won't die after such a short time.  They still like the bounce but they also love their other rubber bouncy ball that's a bit cheaper.  Would I buy this again for the little bit of extra money that this costs just to have the lights?  Not sure since I didn't see them any more excited over the lights than a non-lit ball.  They're still puppies so they're amused by virtually any toy so perhaps</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 9mo is about 75lbs and DESTROYS most toys.

Love to watch it light up the hallway at night. She will play with this ball for hours on end. 1000% recommend &amp; worth the price.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball is amazing! Trip loves loves it!

We have had it for now over a week and it is still in the same shape with no missing parts.  The only thing which they really loved was the light it does not last very long.  I would say it lasted for about a week which really kept my dogs interests.  They still play with it but not as much since the light went out.</span>]"

This is worsened by the fact the ball is hard and not bouncy, and the center seam doesn't seem very durable, and the flashing only lasts about 30 seconds. Critique aside, the ball has held up really well and the flashing is so fun, puppy really loves it. Nice heft, easy to clean. I'll try a different product next time, but if you have a dog with a soft mouth, it does what it's supposed to.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our lab loves to fetch so we have thrown this ball nightly onto soggy grass, snow and ice for the last month and its still working. It flashes brightly and despite being quite hard plastic it hasn't cracked or leaked water inside.

She's not good about bringing balls back, but the Swing n' Fling has a ball and a rope attached to it. So I can tug on the rope, while she has the ball portion in her mouth and it becomes a fun activity where I can actively engage with her. Then I'll toss the other one to get her to drop the first one and just rotate during the play.

I do want to say that I do not like the material used for the rope. It seems like it's made up of plastic fibers and if my dog latches onto any part of the rope while I'm playing tug with her, the rope digs into her gums a little bit and she starts bleeding a bit.

If I did I’m sure he would rip it apart in a few minutes and that would defeat the purpose of the reward. With that being said, this ball looks like crappy quality but it’s great because my dog can get a good grip on it and sink his teeth into it. I’ve used the ball about a dozen times now and it has small little punctures in it but no tears or rips. And he bites down and pulls with all his 85lb body weight. I’ve used Nero balls and only get 3-5 times out of the ball before it breaks. They don’t hold up to his aggressive play style but the Starmark ball has!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Maybe I was misguided thinking my 8 month Pitty would be ok with this medium.

It took 5 minutes to eat the cord. Any size dog could eat through the cord I guess.

The ball hasn’t been eaten it’s lasted, but it’s so light weight you can’t throw it very far.

Very disappointed since I’m elderly and don’t have the money to spend on treats that don’t work.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This item floats and is sturdy.

We’ve been buying Planet Dog Orbee balls (all shapes and sizes- they’re all fantastic!) for almost 20 years.  They’re buoyant, bouncy, easy to clean, smell like peppermint and last for years.   Our most aggressive chewer could keep one alive for 9months, which was huge since everything he chewed typically lasted minutes.

The outer material is very slick! It seems reasonably sturdy but not for heavy chewers. The treat holes are small, which is fine, but to clean the interior it may be difficult or need dishwasher cleaning. If it gets wet and you want to throw it, the wet exterior is smooth and slippery. Overall it's OK but we've only used it twice.The only reason we bought it was to get over the $49 threshold for free shipping.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this second planet orbeez ball.

After a half hour in the yard playing with it, it has holes everywhere- but that being said, he absolutely LOVES this ball! I purchased this, along with the round 10” ball and the purple odd shaped ball for my three Rottweilers and they all loved them! I think if the ball was maybe a couple inches wider, he wouldn’t have been able to get his mouth around it and there would be no holes.  I was hoping he would have taken to the 10” ball and one of my girls would have taken to this one  because they can’t get their mouths around it, thus not being able to pierce it</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have 3 Great Danes that are super power chewers, most toys don’t last long.  This is a great size for them and it truly is indestructible.  The shape makes for fun throwing, as it wobbles and moves in unexpected ways.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 18 month old Portuguese Water Dog made pretty light work of this “Virtually Indestructible” toy. Don’t get me wrong, he loved it, but his love was too much for this football shaped ball to handle. Within a few seconds he managed to work deep groves into the material and in minutes was able to make strategically placed holes that allow him to get his mouth around it and pick it up.  If you’re like me and trying to find toys your hard chewer cannot destroy, this is not the one. Unfortunately, I think the word “Virtually” in the description is the key here.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This eggy is awesome. Virtually indestructible because my pup can’t put the whole thing in his mouth and it’s made with hard plastic so he can’t bite off a bit and keep going. Highly recommend!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We started with the Jolly Egg and she bit through it so quickly.  This toy is made of hard plastic that they can't bite and that is the point!!  Our 11 year old girl bats this around, does the moon walk, spins.  So great for her agility and rehab after her knee replacement.  Keeps her engaged and active.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I should have read reviews posted on here before purchasing this. I also thought it would be a more Kong like material, it definitely is not. My 2 german shepherds were at first scared of the ball, but then had not a clue what to do with it due to it being too large and hard to fit in their mouths.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">my dog is a 3 year old chocolate lab who is ball crazy she loves it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball is too large for a dog to be able to play with it!  It's impossible to play throw and fetch with it. It is also made from heavy duty plastic and is too hard.  The reason it is indestructible is that a dog can't play with it other than push it around the yard!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I don’t even know how this can be considered a dog tog. It’s too hard of plastic for any dog to be able to pick up, not to mention it’s too big even for a giant breed dog.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I honestly thought this would be more of a solid rubber like Kong brand items and it's definitely not!

Tucker is our Australian Cattle Dog (aka Blue Heeler) and his breed is born to bite, chase and be active.  We have bought him a wide range of toys from the expensive to super cheap...meant for big chewers or “indestructible”...basic tennis balls or  rope bones to toys made out of firehose or tire rubber...he’ll sink his teeth in and make it his mission to destroy them...and usually does.  This ball is perfect...and he hates it...so we love it.  He’s tried so hard and exhausted himself trying to pop and bust it like all the countless others, but it won’t budge.  There are many puncture marks, sure but it CANNOT be conquered</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We picked up this jolly ball because my pup loves when I kick a ball for her to chase but she regularly breaks most balls with her teeth. This one is different. It's difficult for her to get her teeth into but she loves it. She is able to carry it with some difficultly (it's hard to squeeze) but its the only ball she hasn't easily broken. I like the blueberry smell as a bonus.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We recently ordered the Jolly Pet Bounce-n-Play Dog Toy in both blue and pink. I fell in love with this brand of ball when I purchased the soccer ball version a few months back. I love that it stays round even with puncture holes. I also love the size! Our pup has a BAD habit of losing all of her toys under furniture. But these balls are big enough to not be able to go under the furniture, so HUGE WIN! Now, I can definitely see how some dogs completely destroy these balls. They are not a hard plastic. And if you let your pup constantly chew on the ball in an attempt to break pieces off, they will in fact be successful at some point.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Boston Terriers love to play with balls but always pop them.   The rubber is tough and they have not popped it.  Definitely recommend for dogs that are tough on toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My German Shepherd absolutely loves this ball and it is surprisingly durable.
I've ordered several of these balls over the years and unlike others it doesn't deflate when punctured. This gives them a lifespan of 6 months or so despite being abused by my ""super chewer"" of a German Shepherd.

...he also uses it to exercise his jaw and get those reps after playing fetch for awhile.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs love the large one best. But this is what the Arizona heat does to it if its left outside. My dog was so sad! She needs a new one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Finally - a ball my dog can chase and grab with her teeth, but she doesn't destroy! It's lightweight, floats in the pool, and soft enough to kick and not hurt your foot. Well worth the money! I highly, highly recommend!!!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I expected it to be much more “rubbery” and have a little more give to it. The video is misleading because it shows someone pressing on it and the ball squishing slightly—this ball does not. It’s pretty much just a solid hard plastic ball.  My dog LOVES his Jolly Pets ball inside a ball but it also is made of hard plastic and Im always afraid he’ll break a tooth or hurt himself somehow while playing with it (he plays rough)—was hoping this could be a slightly softer alternative. It definitely is not.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs love these.  They're the only toy except for Kong type or Nylon chews that they don't destroy almost instantly.  My dog likes when I kick it to him.  I throw like a sissy, so he prefers a kick lol.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have 2 German Shepherds and they both love their Jolly Ball.

What is nice about the foam is that it allows the balls to sit higher on top of the water, so we lose less balls. My dog is not destructive or a heavy chewer to toys and I take the balls away after playtime, so I didn't have the same issues of some of the other dog owners.

My dog loves all toys but he especially loves squeaky toys. I bought this football thinking it wouldn't last very long since the dog is a heavy chewer and boy was I wrong. He chews on this thing non-stop and (luckily) hasn't had the urge to chew off the ends (as he does with every other toy). So far, it's been 6 months and this thing is going strong. It's worn in now but he hasnt gotten a single tooth through the ball or anything. He also is very territorial with it if my other dogs</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Rottweiler absolutely prides herself on destroying squeaky toys.

Almost a week later and it still squeaks! I'm pleasantly surprised.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Anyone who has pit bulls knows that it is hard to find toys that last. I'm ordering 2 more if these. The first one lasted about a week, mostly because we kept on him about not chewing it up. We have hundreds of dead toys.

I suppose I should expect that of a Kong product. I'd definitely get these again - and will, at some point.

This one is perfect because the ball gets just the right amount of bounce when I swing it by the rope, so my dogs go nuts trying to catch it and follow it around. 
And also because the ball slips to the other side of the rope certain times they’ll just boop the ball and have to keep chasing it, but when they catch the rope we play tug for a bit before they’re instructed to drop it. 
Once they’re nice and tired, I put it away. My “four stars” is for the rope... I know if I left it out, my dogs would have that shredded after a few chews.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is one of the few toys that my 45 lbs Blue Lacy has not been able to tear up. The ball is made of a hard rubber not plastic. It is weather resistant with a hole through it in case the rope would need replacing. So funny to watch her whirl it over her head like a helicopter.

It finally split open after being used by him and all the foster dogs. I recently bought two new ones and each of them we had the worst time getting the cylinder out. It’s like the plastic was still melded together and we had to break it free. And even after that it was difficult to unlock and pull it out. I really love this toy for our new pup but either we just got two lemons or they made a change to the mold that makes it impossible to remove. Super frustrating...but seems like other reviewers are having the same issue. It might be time for us to find a new toy that provides him similar enrichment.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I think this product is well made.

She is a mini Aussie, so I have to find many ways to keep her entertained, and this certainly does the trick!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So my dog did not get the concept of this cube and became disinterested in it when the treats would not come out. I paid it forward and gave it to a friend and their dog loves it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Had one of these about 10 years ago and loved it.  Only issue was my stubborn Pug Princess thought it was all for her and would start fights, so I gave it away.  Just ordered a new one for the new puppy to use in her playpen while I work.

My dog is the very definition of an aggressive chewer so this was NOT a good option for her. In addition, the cylinder is impossible to remove.

There is no way for me to clean this toy or to get the remaining</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog has about a dozen feeder toys. I like that this is a cube instead of a ball. My dog loves it and it’s more challenging for her than some of the balls. The food also doesn’t come out as quickly, so she is occupied longer.  As other reviewers mentioned, it is a hard plastic and the center is difficult to open. I have carpeted floors so I don’t mind the plastic.  I ordered the small.

But, I think Football is her favorite word now!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the 2nd or 3rd ball we’ve ordered and the last one barely lasted a couple weeks before it was torn up. All she does is play fetch with it and only outside. Currently it’s my favorite style to throw and for her to catch (not hard or heavy) which is why we ordered it again but hoping to find something that doesn’t disintegrate.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Luna is tough on toys, but she destroyed this toy with in 2 hours.  First, she was able to tear thru the football and pull out everything inside of the black material.  I know she is tough on toys, but I thought she would have it for a little while.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this because my 6 month old puppy loves toys that make the crackle noise. The first thing she did in 10 minutes was pull out a piece of plastic that I had to pry her jaws open to get to the plastic before she swallowed it. I thought I could just pull out the stuffing material and still use the ball but then I noticed that the material the ball was made of was peeling off like a skin. I’m thinking that could have been a defect. Anyway I had to throw it away. If your Dog chews at all I would stay away from this product.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I had hoped that my major chewer would be able to have this last for a while. She had one previously and I thought I would replace it. I didn’t even mind that she pulled the inside out of the football. She ended up having the football in 2 pieces in 1/2 hour. I’ll have to try another toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog absolutely loves this toy but the rubber where the opening are is thin and can be chewed through easily.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I took my ball not even five seconds to destroy this ball</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog doesn’t destroy plush animals or her west paw toys and yet after light chewing of this the green material started to molt off in layers...weird. I had to throw it out 10 min after giving it to her.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog loved this for awhile.  In fact I ordered 2.  He's gifted though and was able to get the black canvas out of the ball and then eat the stuffing inside.  The rubber ball stayed in tact for awhile.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">not worth the buy. something has changed in manufacturing. ZERO QUALITY CONTROL. Bought one of these roughly a year ago for my new puppy. it lasted until about 2 months ago. she finally found a way to get the inside out and tear it up. replaced it. the new one was DESTROYED in less than a day. split completely in half right at the seam in the side, and then my girl demolished it. something changed with the way they make these. dont waste your money.</span>]"

We do not recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this ball for my dogs 2Nd birthday and what a disappointment it was! My pup was so excited to get this new toy and it didn’t even light up like it was supposed to then the 3rd time he played with it the one piece came off so now he can’t even play with it!!!

It could use some improvement.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">During cold winter months here in Michigan we can't often take our dogs outside to play fetch. I have a very busy border collie and on rainy or muddy days we play the game stair ball. it's really simple I just throw the ball down the stairs and our BC goes after it.

It has a good bounce making it fun to catch.  It’s smaller than a tennis ball so it’s easy on their mouths and soft enough to chew.

My border collies are hard on toys but this holds up extremely well!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My previous dogs loved this ball, and played with it every day (and would have all day, if they could). My new pup isn't quite that ball-driven, but still proudly carries hers around, and chases it.

This ball won't last forever; I had to buy two or three each year for my previous girls, but it was well worth it. I don't give it to my new pup to play with, or she'd probably chew it up in no time. We just play with it together when we're outside.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loved the ball...and his teeth went right through it...shredded in just minutes after.  Wish it wss a bit more durable because he seemed super happy for the first 2 minutes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My new rescue dog loves it. The notches give him something to hold. He is part Chihuahua/daushhound so his mouth is small.

It is nice to have instead of touching the whole ball that gets wet and dirty.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">They love these. From this size to the larger sizes.

Balls slated less then a day.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a good enrichment toy for a small dog because they can chew on it and throw it in the air to play with it and carry it around.  It’s great for putting tiny treats in that fall out when they roll it around, but as far as putting a milk bone type treat in it, I don’t think it’s good for that because once they bite the end off that’s sticking out, the other 1/2 remains inside the ball and it’s quite difficult to get it out.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I just brought home my 8 week old German Shepherd and had the 3"" Jolly Ball waiting for him.  I put the handle up to his mouth, he grabbed it and started off across the room shaking his head back and forth.  That's exactly what the  Jolly Ball is for and he loves it.  I will purchase new Jolly Balls as he grows and destroys them.  My previous German Shepherd could tear apart the 8"" Jolly Ball in less than a month.  When it got to the point of looking like a cereal bowl, I gave him a new one.  This is the greatest toy for a large breed, powerful dog to have many fun hours of exercise and fun.  The baby Jolly Ball is just so cute!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Pomeranian loved it! He pranced around and thought he was king. It was fun to watch.

He didn't want this one at first (probably because of it's shape) but the crazy bounce quickly won him over.  He loves the squishy texture, but I can't let him chew on it, as I can already see breakdown.  I love this ball because I don't have to use all my might to get it to go far.  Even a small throw has so many bounces that it sends my energetic boy far across the yard.  This may not be good for a small yard.  It really bounces!  And definitely not a good idea for in the house!  I will buy this again.  Auggie always picks this ball out of the toy box.</span>]"

However it is very hard to squeeze, and my dogs do not care for it. It is also larger than the other ball, so likely uncomfortable to hold as well as not easy to squeak. I remove the squeaker in my balls since we have livestock and I don't want to encourage causing livestock to cry out. There is an air noise caused by squeezing it and that seems to satisfy the dogs. This ball may be more appropriate for a very large dog that is rough on balls.My dogs play with balls only under supervision and they normally last a long time.

He has to have it, in yellow. He is never without it. I've had to replace it a few times (he doesn't know that) because we make him leave it outside so the weather, his constant chomping on it, and catching it mid air makes it crack after a while but my now 100lb German shepherd absolutely cannot be without this ball. He constantly works his jaw on this thing and he's never chewed pieces off of it, just cracked it after some time. The squeaker is always the first thing to go after some chomping time, but it is so loud the whole neighborhood can probably hear it so I'm usually relieved once it stops, lol.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the best toy that my owner has ever brought home.

It works very well with those as a treat dispenser. She is familiar with puzzle toys and it only takes her a few minutes to roll it around and get them out. She actually can pick up the ball which I was surprised by since she is only 13lbs. I was surprised by the size but it works perfectly as a treat dispenser for little dogs. I even cut the zukes treats in half and they fall out even more quickly.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It has a squeaky ball inside but it's so big and the rubber is so thick that it's hard for dogs to get it to squeak.  Also, it's smooth on the outside so get ready for it to get slimy real fast.  Good for bigger dogs and aggressive chewers.   My dog is a full grown German Shepherd and he can barely get the ball in his mouth.  On the plus side he is an aggressive chewer and can't chew through the ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Got this as an add on so we didn't have to pay shipping.  We received it three days ago, and Zeus has not stopped chewing on it since.  Not only that, but he's a GSD, and this thing doesn't have ANY teeth marks on it.  The only reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5 is that the squeaker inside the smaller ball fell out within the first hour.  Other than that, Zeus is happy, so I'm happy.  Will definitely be ordering several more when they come back in stock.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It’s a great bouncing ball, a good size for medium &amp; large dogs. To get the crunch sound the ball has to be squeezed hard so the nubbiez inside touch each other. The ball inside is the squeaker, however the inner ball is so tiny it’s very difficult to make it squeak (if you can make it squeak). An alternative to get your pups attention is to shake the ball it makes a rattling sound.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Love this.. just wish I would had order a smaller size, finally a toy my Mini Dabble Dixie hadn’t chewed up in minutes..</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 13 yet old girl,  Sarena, just loves her ball!

Even if they do fit they get super nasty inside after a little chewing (treat dust + dog slobber...), and it’s not the easiest to clean. 

My dog really likes it though, and she can’t chew through it which is great! She’s fascinated by the little ball moving inside the big one, and it makes a fun noise when it bounces.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog doesn't like this at all lol.

I stuff it with treats that are quite large so they don't come out of the holes as easily, and she does still get them out pretty quickly at this point, but she still absolutely loves rolling the toy around even if it's empty. The inner plastic part is quite noisy, but I like hearing my dog have fun as she plays independently. I can understand why people might not like it, but it's a hit in our house.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">As soon as I broke the air sealed plastic case over the toy, a strong manufactured rubber smell came from the ball. I think my pup was sensitive to the smell, and hesitated to play with it initially. I had to encourage him to play with it, once he realized I put his favorite treats in it. It's also quite noisy, as it was a large plastic noisemakers in the middle of a honeycomb rubber. The noise initially scared him when I dropped the ball onto the floor.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My yellow lab figured this toy out on her first try. The treats come out very easily and she went through ten of them in about 30 seconds. The inside plastic is too heavy, loud and clunky to “toss” this ball as any sort of fetch toy. I can tell that if I let her have it for more than a few minutes the plastic would be torn up in no time, as already shown in a few other reviews.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We are so disappointed in this treat ball.

The interior mechanism is a plastic ball on a plastic tub, the plastic is very durable heavy plastic. It is very noisy, my dog did not want to play with it because it was so noisy when he rolled or tossed it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Fill it with kibble or other small treats. Our dog loves to play with it to get her treat.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The general idea of this toy is fantastic and I use it everyday. My puppy even tried to play with it when no food is inside. However, I can't let her because the blue hol-ee rubber around the dispenser is cheap and easy to chew up. Also the hole that dispenses the food is quite large. There is no difficulty at all, but I would recommend this for first time treat ball users with light chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy seems to be very well made and my dog enjoyed it for a few minutes, but the holder for the food is very small, so it fit didn't work for my needs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We place several small treats in this before leaving the house.

I will say tho, I take it away in the house because my dog loves to “skin” tennis balls and  would definitely be able to chew it up and get the batteries out if I left it on the floor. I don’t think this toy should receive less stars because a dog can chew it up. It wasn’t marketed as indestructible.

My dog likes to kill toys, and I know this.  I buy toys with this in mind.  The reviews led me to believe that once the plush toy was destroyed Helen would have a spike-y rubber ball to play with.  Well, yes and no.  The ball in the belly of this toy is a squeaky rubber ball, but it is easily pierced by a canine tooth.  Once the squeak goes away, so does the fun.  If your dog likes to attack a toy to get to the squeaker, this toy won't last much longer than a traditional, cheaper, plush toy.  The ball is not really a bonus toy; it will be annihilated like any other squeaker.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Adorable, sturdy toy made with fun bight colors!

And the squeak is unique from her other squeakers.  It seems to be her favorite.

He has chewed holes in the two orange ones while trying to get his treats out.  I've had to throw out both of them before he ended up choking on the pieces.  We still have the blue one--his first--and it only has teeth marks-he hasn't been able to chew through that one.

There is a light lip on the inside, however, and this prevents the food from falling out without being hard to fill. Getting the last few pieces requires some work! She can't just stick her tongue in it like some other toys we've tried. 1/4 cup of food takes her maybe 10 minutes.

If you have an extremely aggressive chewer, like my dogs, this is not the right toy for you. My lab got frustrated that she couldn't get the treats and immediately went on a mission to get inside any way she could. She literally shredded one side of this within about a 1/2 hour to 45 minutes.

I tried introducing the tire toy, they don’t like the bell; the smiley face cus they do seem to like squeakers, but they walk off from it after I quit playing with them. I also think they may like the electronic balls, but I have not introduced those yet, either.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Lots of fun toys to keep the pup playing for hours.  The newspaper crinkles &amp; squeaks.  It also contains very funny articles.  The battery operated talking balls are a big hit.  ...except when you accidentally kick them in the night!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Most of the toys were the type that could be chewed up and destroyed. Some of them were made of plastic that would be harmful to your dog or pet if chewed on. You know, dogs like to chew. I would not buy this again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My puppy loves, loves all the toys in this package!  The balls that talk keeps his interest for a long time, he just can’t get enough.

Hazel absolutely loves playing with these. It absorbs enough shock to not roll back as much. Usually with other balls, it bounces against wall and roll back half way, which means less walking for my pup.

After maybe 10 minutes, my morkie had the squeaker exposed and fuzz unraveling on cover. Thought it might be just one defective ball. Gave her another. Same results. I bought a package of four. Not giving her another. She is not an aggressive chewer. Buyer Beware!!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a squeaky ball fanatic. He is 100 lbs but much prefers the small size squeaky balls. These balls get played with and squeaked all day. The squeaker usually lasts anywhere from a couple weeks to a month. Granted, he has probably 20 or more of these balls around the house and he tends to be very gentle with all of his toys. He used to love the Kong squeak air balls, but prefers these now. The actual ball is softer and easier to squeak than the Kong balls. Plus, he can’t pop the squeaker out of the Outward Hound brand balls as easily as he can with Kong balls.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I wouldn't want to be the one who plays fetch with him on Christmas day.

The review below about the owner's dog biting a hole in it is a ""100% no."" That hole is there when it's new; it's the hole for the squeaker!

Hard to squeak with just your hand alone. Played fetch in our house for 4-5 minutes and a single tooth punctured the ball. No more squeaking . She is a Doberman , but isn't even a chewer ....she was just running back and forth squeaking it like a normal dog. For large dogs it just doesn't hold up to their jaw power . The ""foam"" needs to be harder.

Within the first few minutes, I noticed she was pulling off the blue letters, so I pulled the rest off myself and gave it back. Then she began chewing up the rope. It didn't take long to chew right through. There are some pieces of rope left, so tugging with her is still possible, but she usually brings us her orbee-tuff squeak ball for that. I would replace a stronger rope, but this one has a big knot inside the ball, and can't be pulled out through the small holes.

She loves to play tug of war with the rope, and she loves to chase the ball when I throw it - it's very bouncey.

It just doesn't interest them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My bigger dog loves the larger size bounce-n-play ball, in part because of it's texture (foamy).  I bought a smaller bounce-in-play for my smaller dog, but it is not the same material as the larger size or if it is, it is denser than the large.  It appears as just another hard plastic ball, non-crushable.

The hard plastic and  tennis ball felt cover proved to be a good match for my girl.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves it just to big for him. Need a small version for small dogs</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Labrador pup tore tennis ball material off first day. She's a pretty aggressive chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The outer part (tennis ball material) didn’t hold up to my pup. My boy chewed it off in no time at all but even with that gone he loves it. He loves catching it and playing tug of war with it. I’d buy it again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My lab loves this thing!   It is well constructed and after two weeks of chewing it still looks new.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">He likes it, but not his favorite. This is one he could take or leave.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">From my tiniest mini-Daschunds to my gentle, 130lb Great Pyranese, this toy is a HUGE HIT! It is their ABSOLUTE FAVORITE TOY! After years of running a dog rescue on 10 acres of land, 11 dogs eventually found permanent homes-with me. Believe me when I say that it takes a LOT of dog toys to keep my guys happy and entertained! They need lots of variety for mental stimulation and fun, and I need them to NOT eat my furniture... This toy is FANTASTIC! It can roll for long distances, bounce in random directions, and keep them busy for hours. They love to toss it around, and lay down and knaw on it. The rubber is chewy but tough, and I myself have not experienced the tennis ball  part coming off,  ever</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 7 mos old pup, Cooper, loves this.  Throwing it around and jumping on it.  So cute! Unfortunately, he always looks for the weakest point and had the tennis ball hide ripped off this in 5 mins!  I cut off the parts he was ripping so he couldn't ingest them. Normally I throw out toys he has ripped into, but once the hide is off this its like a Kong so it is still fun and safe for him, I guess.</span>]"

However she disabled the squeaky part pretty quickly.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was excited that Ruff Dawg make squeaky balls as my dog LOVES the indestructible rubber balls that I purchased.  The squeaky balls are super light weight and thin skinned.  She killed the squeaker in less than a minute and had chewed a hole in minute two.  Fair warning - if you have a strong chewer, this is not the ball for them - get the Rock or the Indestructible Balls - they are fantastic!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I run a dog rescue, and the majority of my dogs love squeaky balls (of course). I have only had one dog out of ALL of them who WOULD destroy this ball or any ball for that matter. I have had 3 of these for 2 years now  and am buying a couple more.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Worst ball ever!! Playhouse ball pit type of ball, not the consistency I was expecting! Lasted 1 whole minute until it was tore to pieces!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Ball is very thin and lasted about 5 minutes with my dog.  Way overpriced for a cheap ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I always love Chewy’s and I generally never ever have a complaint. This one time I had asked if some of the multiple squeaky balls I ordered could be red in color or at least have a variety. I ended up with three blue ones. I was told by the receptionist that whatever they choose at the warehouse is what I get and she had no control over that. You guys need a place where one can write a note when ordering something. I ordered the same balls from another online pet warehouse where they offered a comment section and I got exactly what I wanted as far as color. 
I’ll still give you four stars just because this is really the only time I’ve been a tad disappointed. Also each ball was a bit more expensive</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Huge fan of ruff dawg typically, but this toy is tiny, super lightweight, and low quality. Reminds me of the cheap plastic ball pit type balls. 

Also has the worlds most
Obnoxious, High pitched squeaker. I typically have no problem tuning them out. But this one was bad.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Every few months I have to buy another but so what? No, this is not the toy to throw at your dog and let him out in the backyard by himself. But that’s true of most toys. This is a lightweight plastic baseball type ball. You don’t play tug-of-war with this; you don’t let your dog rip it up; but this is my dogs favorite toy. I live in an apartment and, when this is thrown, doesn’t break anything including my dogs teeth.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was so disappointed when I got it out of the pack, it didn’t even last 5 minutes. As soon as it went in my dogs mouth their teeth went right in it and popped it. It’s literally just like the little balls that go into a kids ball pit only it has a squeaker inside.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The toy lasted 5 mins out of the package.

If she can't wait for me to play she'll run around with it shaking her head to make it swing. It's easier for me to throw longer distances because of the bungee type cord. I gave it only 4 stars because the cord at the end of the rubber ""handle"" frayed and tore off. I tied a knot in it so I could still whip it further. I will get another one eventually.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We found this toy at our local, independently owned pet store before the creator sold it to Kong.  Our dog absolutely loves this toy and he will run around with it for hours on end. It’s very simple to use and our kids can throw the ball long distances b/c of the bungee cord attached to the ball.  You won’t regret this purchase.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought 3 for my squeaker lover and sadly, despite the packaging saying they squeak...they don’t.

Maybe the most durable non nylon toy I’ve gotten him yet.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got one of these about 10 years ago that seemed indestructible. This one, my English bulldog mix tore the handle to pieces in about 15 minutes. Really disappointing! Not recommended for chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Had to take a couple stars off, because it already has multiple punctures after only 3 days and definitely will not last much longer. However, the dog is OBSESSED! He chases it and carries it around the yard. He pushes it around in his kiddie pool and it even floats. Wish it was a little tougher, but he is happy, so I am happy. Maybe the biggest size will last longer</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I love the idea of this ball. I bought the one with the handle because I wasn't sure if he'd be able to grip the ball alone to carry [he could btw]. Unfortunately the dog we bought it for didn't understand the purpose of the handle. He just thought it was for chewing... and he did. He chewed off both corners in less than 30 minutes after about the third time of playing with it. Thought about just removing the handle, but it doesn't look to be sealed off where it attaches to the ball, so he'll probably just keep tearing pieces out of it. Again, I like the idea of the ball, but I think it would have been better if we'd gotten the one without the handle. Just not the right fit for this particular</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We only had this ball 4 days before the handle broke during supervised play. The quality of the handle is very poor and not durable. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money on this ball if you have a strong dog.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pit bull loves these types of balls! They last forever and he is TOUGH on toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball completely entertains my pup!!! The rubber is still quite hard and Wilbur did hurt his nose trying to boop it like a volleyball. My dog will chew anything kind of handle or extremities off on all his toys but he hasn't wanted to chew the handle off because he like to shake the ball :) Its been a great investment for our pups!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves the jolly ball. They can get beat up pretty quick depending how obsessed your dog is. If I leave him unattended outside, he’s been known to start chewing pieces off.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this for my 9 month old Corgi. I thought it was chew resistant....not so. He immediately started chewing the handle and can easily chew plastic chunks off of the toy. I’m putting it away for a few months and will try again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is always unsure of new toys, well he loved this one right away! He is a tough chewer so I won’t leave him with the ball or he will have the handle chewed off sooner than later. But he loves running around the yard chasing this toy.

She fell in love with it after finding it at a relatives house with toys for little dogs. She enjoys that it’s soft so she can walk around chomping on it. Also it bounces all different directions when she throws it. But I’m sure if she wanted to destroy it she could so wouldn’t recommend if you have a large dog that destroys everything.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Way to small for a medium size dog. It is about the size of a tennis ball</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pug enjoys puzzles and is motivated by food so this toy is just what she needed. She loves it!

I like that they come in sets of blue and yellow, which are colors that dogs can see!  (Dogs are red-green color blind, so that bright red ball appears grey to your canine).  These balls also stand out nicely to the human eye.

One of my sets is a squeaky model, which is difficult to squeeze in a way that makes it squeak.  These are generally tough enough for my dog who is not a hard core chewer, although he does defuzz and split open a regular tennis ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Being the ""tuff"" version I hoped this ball would last. We just started using them for fetch and the holes in the sides prove to be a gateway for the dogs to chew them into pieces!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Sturdy balls great for my chewer and good size for small dogs</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is an unusual aggressive chewer, and the ridges and holes  meant there was a lot for him to grab on to and chew.

PS I just never write reviews, but this is worth it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The ball is a nice weight for throwing, appears durable after a month of play, and has great bounce. The flat bottom doesn't really cause as much erratic bounces as the description states, but it's fun nonetheless. I've been impressed by the West Paw products. It's worth the bit of extra money to me to have something that will last more than 5 minutes.

Still, I was a bit disappointed by this design, because it's flat side didn't cause the erratic bounce it promised and instead functioned like any other ball. The dogs don't seem to mind, but after having retrieved it from the gazillionth roll beneath the furniture, I'm ready for West Paw to fetch a new design (hint: think, football)!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Smiley loves the ball.

We haven't had to replace the second, even after a few months of VERY heavy use, and our dog has put this thing to the test.

It has a squeaker and both like to bite it and make it squeak.  It has lasted a long time, but recently the cat chewed it for a prolonged period of time and made little holes in the leg area.  Based on the cat damage, I'm afraid that pieces will come off, so I'm replacing it and buying a few more as back ups.  It has held up for several months before the cat did major damage to it.

It's held up great since our last autoship, but the battery has died, and there doesn't appear to be a way to replace it (it's not rechargeable). I wish the battery lasted longer, but it definitely lit up great before it died. Honestly though, the toy has outlasted my expectations even it doesn't light up anymore, we still use it during the day. We have a large dog that destroys her toys typically in about a week, this was a pleasant surprise. Will probably order 2 next time it goes on sale. I wish it was available in large size.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This would be an awesome product if only it were more durable. It definitely did not hold up to fetch with our OEB. He likes to chew his ball as he runs back. I bought 2. The 1st was dead less than 24 hrs after it was opened. Between the chewing on the run back &amp; the impact this heavy ball makes on the ground, it died.
The 2nd didn't make it a month &amp; we were quite careful about the chewing getting him to drop immediately upon return. 
I want to love this product because I was quite excite about never losing the ball at night, but at over $10 per ball, they just arent worth it. Maybe if you have a dog with a soft mouth that doesn't chew at all.... but that's not a bulldogge.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have Nite Ize dog tags so we decided to try out this ball. It’s very sturdy and durable unlike regular rubber balls that my dogs destroy. The light is VERY bright, almost like a flashlight. It doesn’t just glow, so you can kinda see surrounding areas where the ball is. It’s fun to watch our dogs play fetch with it</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I often get home late from work and feel guilty. These balls are amazing for playing late night fetch! I will say, even though batteries are replaceable I just buy new ones because it only seems to last an additional 2 weeks after replacing batteries and the ball stops working!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">there were NO replacement batteries to start when opening. And first night of trying it out... it doesn't work. It worked for 10 minutes after I pulled the tab out and once it got dark to play fetch. It won't even turn on. Very disappointing</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Ball is my dog's favorite game but as soon as winter started to come around and it was getting dark by 5pm, it got harder to go out and play after I got off work. Then the snow came and we were losing balls in the inches of snow and had to wait until it melted to find them. I started looking for a light up ball, so that we could keep playing through the dark/snow. Being cooped up isn't exactly a great option for a Doberman. I stumbled upon Nite Ize here on Chewy and decided to give them a try. They are the BEST I have ever found. The light stays on until 10min of inactivity. So, we have plenty of time to find them both in the dark and snow if we need it. They're so bright you can see them through</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a fantastic toy for our two dogs.  It is very bright for night playing which is important not only for play but makes retrieval easy for us if it gets knocked out of the yard.  No more lost balls.  The only drawback is that the batteries don't seem to last very long.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was wanting a ball that lights up when I take my dogs at night and early morning. I first one I tried failed miserably ( didn't even work out of package) and the dogs crunched it first throw. Chewy was awesome and refunded my purchase without even asking, so I gave this one a try. WINNER! Not only does it stay lit, change colors, it is rubbery and the light is very protected. It also works in the pool! Highly recommend!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball is easy to see after dark and my dog loves that it allows his teeth to sink in a little when he carries it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">“Santa” left this ball in my husky puppy’s stocking.  She LOVES it as do I, especially during this time of the year when it gets dark by 5pm but she still wants to play outside when it’s 20 degrees!  Perfect brightness, tough exterior, bounces too!  It does take an “effort” to get it to light up - bouncing on a hard floor/driveway works well. Pounding in your hand won’t do it, nor will shaking it. Great purchase!</span>]"

She took such good care of that toy. Then along came Zoe, the rambunctious puppy. She got that football and tore it to shreds.

BUT much of the secret to its durability for the aggressive chewer is it being too large and smooth for the jaws to get any type of handle on it.  I had to work with my dogs for a bit to get them to understand the concept, and one of them who feared it at first is especially excited now to try and tackle her elusive ""prey"" ... it gives her much needed exercise and proves self-entertaining, so I am fairly happy with this USA-made purchase.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a very mouthy Dutch/mal mix who loves the Jolly Football &amp; the whole line of Chuck-it toys. The 2 sizes of Jolly Egg were fails due to his not being able to grab them with his mouth &amp; retrieve them. They're smooth &amp; slippery &amp; too big to get his mouth on.

My yard is lined with woods, so I've lost the ball several times on the first throw because the light didn't come on, neither me or my dog can find it, and I'd have to wait until daylight to go find it.

Not worth the money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">First, you need to know we have two aggressive and strong chewers, a GD and a 50-pound TWC/beagle mix named Dutchess. Dutch did destroy this toy eventually, but it lasted much longer than most soft toys. She is both smart and stubborn and fairly quickly pulled the plastic center with its treats out of the cloth so it was easier for her to get out the treats. The cloth section was then used for tug of war with her sister. I believe it would be quite good for less aggressive chewers or smaller dogs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Received this for a valentine gift. My puppy of 3 months old, had it demolished in 10 minutes. It is not anywhere near as strong or durable as it states on here.  Really hope she didn’t swallow anything.

Not. This toy was destroyed by my little baby within minutes after getting it. Would not recommend. I was going to get the small one since she is small, and changed it to medium if my bigger baby wanted to play with it. And the size of the medium could be considered small. Very disappointed. Wish I wouldn't have wasted my money on this.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 65 lb. girl whose goal is apparently to destroy any toy she gets. I thought “Extreme” meant it was for extreme play. It only took about 5 minutes for her to get the treat ball out of the thin canvas-like material, and then rip the trim off and chew a big hole in it. The ball is still a good toy I guess, but she prefers the bounce of a regular old tennis ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It is smaller than I thought it would be but my dogs love to throw this toy around to get treats.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It survived my dog who's nickname is Capt.

It was a big ball with a smaller ball inside that dispenses treats.  She finally broke it after many years of play.  This one has a large opening so if you put kibble in even if it's large it will fall out.  You hold it in with your finger and turn the inside ball but it does not take much for the inside ball to turn and release the treats.

As far as dispensing food with it, I haven’t found the right size food yet. The kibble is too small.It falls right out. All the treats we have are too big. Can’t get them in even though they are quite small. We may just use it for peanut butter treats, but not sure how difficult it will be to clean.

After squeezing it back into mostly proper shape, I attempted to put treats in it. Any treat I put in immediately fell out the other side. I tried to arrange the inside ball so that the holes didn't line up with the outside ball but the inside but I couldn't get the inside ball to move without the outside ball.  I couldn't even get the treats to stay inside the toy.  No challenge for my dog.  My dog has not interacted with this toy except the one roll to get the treats to fall out.

However, this ball is NOT bouncy.   It is nothing special and not worth the money.  Dog is not very interested in it either.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 9 month old, Goldendoodle pup absolutely LOVES this ball! It is harder ball but, it has just enough give to it that she's able to pick it up &amp; retrieve it. She's a major power chewer and a pro at destroying toys but even though there are a million puncture holes in it, it's still in one piece and she plays with it every chance she gets. For size reference, I got her the 6"" ball and she's 45 lbs.

Wish I could get it in a mini version it would be perfect for my Merry.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was hoping my dog would be able to get a grip on this ball and carry it around, along with chasing it. He is an aussie and likes to do both with his balls. This ball, although not hard plastic, may as well be hard plastic. There is next to no give. It is still a good ball for him to chase, but not to fetch.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got the 8inch ball for my 8 month old Rhodesian Lab mix. The ball is very firm and a bit heavyish to play with and my puppy really pays no mind to it. Maybe I just got her the wrong size. I got her the biggest size because previously she had a soccer ball that big which she loved but she turned it into nothingness so I decided to get her another ball thinking she would enjoy it. I thought this ball would be a bit lighter and somewhat easy for her to grab with her teeth thinking it would be a softer material if that makes any sense.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was quite hopeful to have found a ball for my power chewer. She LOVED this ball. So much so, that she played with it for 2 hours non-stop. However, she was able to do some damage in that time. After 24 hours, the ball was quite chewed and had a large hole (see pic). Not worth the money. The ball was too expensive to have only lasted 2 hours.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Noot loves this toy! I bought the one that looks too large for his mouth.  It's firm enough for him to lean his chest on while he cradles it between his front legs, but the texture is spongey enough to dent it enough to get a bite, and then soft enough to bite all the way down.  It needed one puncture to start the process, which it got in the first 3 minutes of play, and since then I'm sure it has acquired many more but has not affected it's performance.  I love how it always and immediately goes back to a full sphere, even between chomps, so there is never an edge from a dented in ball to chew on.

I bought this version for when I am not supervising her since the handle on the other does eventually get chewed off. This ball seems a little bit tougher to chew, but it is not hard like the push and play versions.

After catching it a few times and squeezing it, one of the blue sides came apart and before long the other side came apart.  She then decided that she wanted to chew the blue part so I tore the rest of it off.

This is a launch toy. I’m certain if I leave it in the floor after playtime, it would be in pieces. That being said, it is a sturdy and well made launcher. You can really put some distance on this one without feeling it is going to break.  Then put it away.

https://www.chewy.com/rogz-pop-upz-dog-toy-color-varies/dp/177310,"Rogz Pop-Upz Dog Toy, Color Varies","[<span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a great fetch toy!  I wish the rubber section at the bottom of the toy was made of more durable material. Perhaps basketball material?  Once there is an indent or defect from the dogs tooth the rubber can be easily picked off if the dog chews on this a little.  It is easily picked off to expose the under layer which is soft and easily breaks apart.  She still loves this toy to fetch, but I throw it less because she wants to chew on the now “defected” area.   I love the design of this toy, wish there were more like this, but more durable.  I do recommend this toy, but absolutely not to let your dog chew the slightest.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">If you have mastiffs don't bother, mine chewed this up in a matter of minutes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">One of my dogs just LOVES this toy!  And it actually lasted for over a week before she finally chewed it up and it had to be thrown away.  So, I've ordered another one....not the best for tough chewers....</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs love love love this toy!  It’s odd shape makes it unpredictable when thrown, which keeps the dogs interested and coming back for more.  I feel the weight helps me throw it more easily.  I admit it does not right itself unless on flat even ground. But that does not stop the fun. Not meant for chewing (or in my case unsupervised play). Handles light tug of war.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog ripped this up in less than 5 minutes. Not a sturdy toy</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is not a super durable toy but my dogs seem to like it once they tried it out, and the cat likes the medium size one.  They like how it bounces wherever and how it sort of is a handle to pick it up.  One dog in particular likes to run with it.  It does mostly pop upright as designed. It would not survive heavy chewing though.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Item description said ""Durable material satisfies your pal’s chewing instinct"", which is why I bought it. Great pool toy...just don't let your pup chew on it. Very disappointed. Just delivered today and it is going in the trash.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It seemed like a good idea but the rubber is not very sufficient.  My mini doodle had it almost chewed up in a couple of hours.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was to be a chew toy. All of a sudden our 8 month old pup had this to pieces. It was out of the box for 2 hours.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Much smaller than I thought, and didn't last long in our house.</span>]"
