We have a 3 month border collie mix puppy, and most of the reviews that this didn't work for have dogs that were bigger or better chewers, so I thought. I didn't think she would get through it as fast as she did. The pink one was chewed up in less than an hour. She really loved it, but we can't safely let her keep chomping it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I do not know how to rate this. The puppy this was purchased for is a 10 wk. old Irish Wolfhound.
She carries this toy around quite a bit; however, she does not chew on it.  I do not know if it is the texture or the hardness of it.  She chews her other toys that are smoother and less hard.  I believe that it is this puppy’s preference and nothing to do with the toy itself. That is why I gave it a three; I have no clue as to how it will hold up if she does ever actually chew it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was impressed with the toy at first, being it is made from a hard plastic.  However when I gave this to my pup, he had it chewed up in less than an hour!!  I do not recommend this toy for dogs who chew on everything or bigger breed pups.  I ordered this with 2 squeak toys which I refuse to give him those as I know he will destroy them in no time as well.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">this is the winner of our chewy haul. ordered a variety of chew toys to try out for our new puppy and so far this is her favorite. she's only 9 weeks old, and like chewing on our fingers (ouch!) this toy is just slightly softer than a normal chew toy and she loves it. having a couple toys and ring seems to entertain her more than a typical bone. will it last forever? probably not. but nice to not have puppy shark teeth attacking my fingers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this toy for my 9 week old Yorkie and it seems to be one of her favorite chew toys. She's been chewing everything up and this particular toy is great for redirecting her and holding her attention. The toy doesn't seem to be worn out yet so I expect it to last quite a while.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 3 month old GoldenDoodle he loved this in the first few days I gave it to him and the other weeks had past and he still plays with it and it’s definitely in his top 5 he plays with most but when I was washing his toys for its weekly wash I have been noticing teeth marks on the ring and some on the toys but I didn’t think much about since there was nothing that bad on it that would choke or do something bad to him. but right now he is playing with it and it’s in pretty good shape just hopefully nothing bad happens!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is well made, but our puppy is totally disinterested in it.  I thought it would be a great chewy toy, but even when I give it to him and try to pull and entice him to play with it, he doesn't care.  He goes off to find something else.  This could just be my dog, I have no idea how other pups would react.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Good quality.  Bought this for the pup as she is starting to teeth.  The toy is a little bigger than I expected but that is ok.  I appreciate that there is two chewys on the ring.  I put them in the freezer for awhile and then give them to the pooch.  The bumpies on the chewys in addition to the cold from the freezer helps keep her interested.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a great chew toy for our puppies! We had gone to purchase puppy chew toys at stores because we needed something right away, and the stores only had plushies and kongs! We don't use plushies because the puppies chew them and eat the bits, and the kongs were just too big. These are perfect for our 8 week old puppies to teath on and they love them!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is one of the first chew toys I bought my pup when we got him. I thought it was cute. He loved it. So did my older pups. (the other two are 5). It's been chewed until it's just nubs and a ring. So I buy another.  I'm not sure how many I've purchased but I keep buying them when they start to break because my pup (who is now a 14 month old 50 lb chinese shar pei) loves this and who am I to say no? so, yes, I know it's for teethers, but my lil' guy said he's still teething and to give him his binky back.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/nylabone-teething-pacifier-puppy-chew/dp/39345,moderate,chew toys

Also, if you're on a budget, you can simply buy some peanut butter and spread it around the inside with a kitchen knife. Saves your house from teething destruction and they are also the best tool I have found for separation anxiety. Even my adult dogs get one right before I leave the house, and they don't even care that I'm leaving.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Just got this today and I know it's goofy to write a review right away about an item/purchase BUT(!) I tested it out as soon as I got home with my dog - he's usually iffy about toys or anything that is NOT food... I filled it with the cheese &amp; Bacon spray and he just went to town! Absolutely loves it. I've been thinking about getting one of these for a while but finally gave in and happy I did!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the perfect size for a puppy.  Only complaint was I ordered pink and received blue.  Puppy didn't mind but the owner gave me a hard time (jokingly).  Puppy loved it and it does keep her entertained when owner needs quiet time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Smaller than I expected and I ordered a size bigger than what I was expecting. Other than that it’s good, my dog likes it as a treat.
I put kibble in it, wet it, then freeze it but you don’t need to freeze it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Even as a puppy, my dog was quite a chewer. And, as most puppies do, she had absolute razor-blade teeth. She would poke holes in this and rip pieces of rubber off of it. Before it was damaged, it was really useful to cram full of peanut butter and freeze for her to get out when she was having separation anxiety.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It doesn't save the fingers and hands from sharp tiny milk teeth but, Yellow Dog loves to toss it around and make it bounce and chase after it and chew on it, lol! So energy outlet wise it is a great toy from puppies!!! :D</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Finally, a really tiny chew toy for my Pug puppy.  She will actually be able to grab it and it is indeed softer than the standard Kong,  I ordered the small as well because she may grow out of this tiny XSmall one quickly but it is the perfect starter!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is his favorite Kong. We ordered it in blue (for a boy) . Although, when I called customer service to request the blue one, they told me they can not guarantee the color that will come. It DID arrive in blue!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Chihuahua/Pug mixed babies are massive chewers. Most of the items I give to them are destroyed in a few hours (or less). They love the challenge of getting their treats, and they are easily cleaned and sanitized. Hooray for me AND my babies!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This puppy kong is easy for my 12 lb girl to carry around and chew. I wish it was a bit shorter because she can't get the squeeze cheese or peanut butter and the end of the treat. It's really difficult to clean, but I will keep using it because it holds treats well and she loves it!</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/kong-puppy-dog-toy-color-varies-small/dp/38488,moderate,chew toys

My hound likes to chew on my wood coffee table and wood toybox when I go to work. They like this toy, but it's not their favorite. It's heavy to throw, but would be okay outside.  It's very well made and good quality, so I upped my review from 3-stars to 4 because it's not the company's fault my dogs are picky about the wood they chew. From my dogs' behaviors, I'd bet that this toy tastes like wood. (I did not taste this toy.) I'm satisfied with the purchase, not sure if it's for everyone. Sometimes the dogs will gnaw on it while they're chilling on the couch, but not for long. I have a medium dog </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is much more plastic-y than woody. My dogs enjoyed chewing on them but I set a time limit being afraid it would wear their teeth too much. I have a middle-aged boxer with small teeth and lab with big teeth who loves to chew sticks. I won't buy this again. Not horrible but I really don't like the hard plastic feel. Also loud when dogs drop it on hard flooring. I think even if some material gets ingested, it seems safer than if dogs ingest real splintery wood. Pros and cons.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a durable toy they keeps it’s shape even when the dogs are trying to destroy it. I have not had any sharp edges yet but we do get some peace’s broken off as they chew so we watch for that.

The love the way it feels and gives them a good gripping surface. If you have a medium (50lb) dog I would not go smaller then the  medium and would recommend leaning towards the next size up.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The two dogs that visit my house regularly love these sticks. The only complaint I have is that it leaves hard little bits that I have to clean up after every chew session. i will add that I have to clean up after every rope toy or other material is played with as well. They are super aggressive chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dogs both chew on sticks like it's going out of style, but we didn't want to encourage that, especially in the house. We got them each one of the dogwood tough toys and they LOVE them!! They typically choose these over a normal Nylabone. If you have a chewer I would highly recommend this product!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this for my highly destructive German Shepherd Dog who can destroy toys in seconds. We’ve had this for two weeks and it’s still holding strong. I will say that she doesn’t find the toy to be that fun, though. It’s very hard and doesn’t seem to give her a lot of satisfaction.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog usually loves these kinds of hard chew toys but for some reason wasn’t a big fan of this one. He did chew it up but it wasn’t nearly as interesting to him as other chew toys before. The quality of the bone is otherwise excellent and a good durable choice for big chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Got this when my dog was smaller and it stopped him from bringing sticks inside. He’s had the same one for over a year until I just threw it away. 10/10 recommend, I’ll be purchasing another one really soon. It’s his favorite toy to chew on that he actually doesn’t destroy!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I first tried these on the recommendation of an employee of a pet store. My lab/terrier mix would actually  chew through small sapplings in my yard in order to get sticks for his chewing obsession.  He loves these. They only last about a month before they get so small that I have to toss them, but most toys only last a day on my house.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 6 month old goldendoodle likes to chew, but she’s never ruined even stuffed animals. And yet... she’s been chewing on the dogwood for less than 10 minutes and it’s already starting to flake. I’m worried about her eating too much of it so I’ll have to take it away soon, which is a bummer because a. It’s more expensive than a beef tendon and lasts even less time, b. she really likes it, and c. I literally gave it to her 8 minutes ago. Thought this could help cut on some tendon/bully stick expenses and calories. What a shame. Also, it’s almost too heavy for her to carry.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/petstages-dogwood-tough-dog-chew-toy/dp/46955,moderate,chew toys

It’s dishwasher safe but usually I just rinse it with some mild pup safe soap. The cats show zero interest so this is not one of those “cats love it too” type of instances. Wait, I take that back. They do love it because it keeps the dog busy. They can focus on napping, which from what I can tell, takes hours of concentration.

I should’ve just bought another kong stick.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves toys and destroys toys(bull terrier) she chews this gorilla then spits it out. So I think she gets a taste of baking soda that she doesn’t like. This works o.k. For me, I always watch them with toys because I don’t want them to tear up and ingest the things. But it is so nice to have one that doesn’t get destroyed and doesn’t go under the furniture either.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 45 lb female German Shepherd mix really enjoyed chewing this toy. However, when my male 80 lb Anatolian Shepherd got a hold of it... game over lol! He ripped chucks off of it like it was nothing. So if you’ve got a big doggo like me, I would choose a different chew toy. However, it worked great for my medium size girl!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog was chewing up everything, I have had this gorilla for almost a year and it is still in almost new condition and it is my dogs favorite toy! This is an outdoor dog and I recently got a pup and saw them playing tug with it. I think it is great!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog was mildly interested in this when I would put treats in the dispensing cavity but it was so small and deep into the treat that my dog was unable to get even the smallest training treats out, leaving her frustrated and me having to dig my finger in to fish them out before they start rotting and stinking. Great idea but the execution needs some work.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">For my 6 mo pup, this toy is too heavy for her to run and carry and she doesn’t chew on it often, but I think when she does the grooves help her teeth? Also, only put tiny treats in it or you’ll never get them out!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our girl Jeep, a little cattle dog mix, loves this toy so much as a chew, for catch and  as a little pal. I have multiples for back just in case ...</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have tried other Kong-like toys with my husky but she never bothered with them. I’ve had this toy for about 7 months now and she plays with it every single day. I did have to cut some of the prongs shorter so her treats come out. She throws it around the house every night, regardless if there are treats in there or not. She doesn’t really chew on it like other reviewers have mentioned. After 7 months the toy looks untouched, it holds up so well! This is literally the only toy she plays with now!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves chewing on this. He likes to chase it due to its erratic bounce and then accidentally drop it and it starts all over.  So far minimal damage on the toy but chewing hasnt been his sole focus. 
I would not get it as a treat dispenser it is nearly impossible to get them out even with fingers. I might try and put in a bully stick type treat and see how that goes. It does have a very strong odor that hasn't gone away but doesn't seem to bother my dog and the humans have gotten used to it.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/arm-hammer-dental-super-treadz-tough/dp/145289,moderate,chew toys

It's not soft or rubbery, so it takes her a while to actually gnaw at it. Unfortunately, it only took her a couple of days to gnaw through the thin pieces connecting it to the hard-plastic ring, so now we just have three random keys floating around the house.

The keys came off the ring as soon as they started chewing on it.   Also, once bitten, pieces of the keys are easily able to be bitten off by strong chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 4 month old puppy comes back to this toy every day. It holds his attention the longest. He is a heavy chewer and finds such joe with this. We freeze it overnight and he loves it best when it is cold.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My puppy loved to chew on this but it made her breath awful.

I like to give it as a gift too.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This began to crumble in my dogs mouth within the first few minutes of play.  It wasn't the result of aggressive chew, rather, the result of a defective product.  You can tell because it started to break off in smooth geometric patters rather than his teeth-shape.  I'm really disappointed in this and for the first time EVER, the KONG brand.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this thinking it would last as a toy for my bullys to play with during the day while they are out side and I’m doing chores. within the first day they had it tore up. I have the big round ones that are amazing but if you have a chewer i do not recommend this toy for them. Other wise my dogs loved it! It is good for fetch!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Guess my dog was too tough for this toy. I purchased 2, because I have 2 lab mix rescues and within a day they both had chewed the ends off. I was afraid they would swallow the pieces so I took them away from them. Guess I need a tougher toy. These might work for smaller dogs or not aggressive chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Was very disappointed with this KONG toy. My pup had it for no more than 10 minutes when the rubber started flaking off into tiny pieces. I guess this toy isn't intended for dogs that are chewers? Bummer since we have really liked all other KONG items we have purchased</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this toy for my fury kids. It's very challenging and keeping them occupied for a long time. However, the combination of the shape of the toy and their hard-working saliva attracts almost everything on the floor and carpet. Each time when they play with this toy, I need to wash it thoroughly to make sure nothing is inside and out. Otherwise, its a great concept!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This Kong seems to have gotten a bit sturdier since we bought the same one a few years ago. This is probably a good thing, since the old one succumbed to my dog's modest chewing. He works a little harder on this one to get his biscuit out -- also a good thing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So maybe my shepherd lab isn’t a genius, but it’s so tough to get treats out of this thing! The only way is for your dog to chew hard on the toy which breaks up the kibble/treats, while the fall out the sides in tiny specks that you have to vacuum up later. I tried shoving a rawhide bone in there which kept her entertained for a long time (and even left bite marks on it), but the bottom was so stuck it eventually took me prying the soggy thing out with a spoon. Solution: on one side I cut one of the flaps off, and now it’s perfect. She can roll it and flip it around and eventually food will come out without her losing interest.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Did not last even 5 minutes. I never even had a chance to put treats in it. My pup destroyed this toy! Power chewers beware it will not hold like the actual Kongs do. Very disappointed in this king toy. Should have looked through more of the reviews.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is huge and extremely durable but not for aggressive chewers.

The squeakers are right on the end of each piece and those were gone before I picked up the last of the plastic. Great if you want confetti, not so much if you like a clean living room</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pup immediately loved this toy, it’s an interesting shape and has 3 different squeaks which he is a big fan of. Unfortunately, he’s a professional chewer and was destroying this toy within the first day of getting it. 

He definitely is enjoying it, but it will be a short lived play item as he breaks it down and the squeaks no longer function...

Would recommend this toy if 1. Your dog is smaller/doesn’t tend to destroy toys via incessant chewing or 2. You don’t mind a shorter life span as long as the pup is having a good time while it lasts. :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I can't believe how long this toy has lasted..it's been almost a year since we got this for our Golden Retriever puppy. He has destroyed many other toys but this one still survives.  It has a fun bounce and different squeakers. The squeakers don't work so well anymore but it still bounces and he still plays with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have two power chewers that have destroyed lots of toys. They love squeaky toys but usually they are only good for limited play before they are destroyed. This toy is 2 weeks old and STILL has the squeakers working!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Mini Aussie Loves this toy so much he takes it to bed with him. Very tough material as many of his toys only last 1 day. I highly recommend this toy if your dog loves to fetch and chew...</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 4 mo old puppy chewed off pieces of the rubber within minutes of chewing it so we took it away. Two of the 6 squeakers didn’t work when it arrived. Not a good toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Plott Hound adored chewing this item and to listen to the squeaking sounds it made. It took four days to completely demolish it. Not made for a big time chewer, but it is enjoyable to chew!</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/outward-hound-triple-jack-squeaky-dog/dp/174920,moderate,chew toys

I got this toy because Kong toys tend to last a lot longer than anything else that isn't constantly policed usually being lost rather than destroyed. Somewhere beyond my back fence where the deer ticks and red bugs roam is a fortune worth of Kong toys. We're going on a couple of months now and the toy has held up really well against hours of daily rough tug of war and chewing. Its large enough that they can comfortably tug of war with it and it throws well but doesn't have quite the bounce of the regular cone shaped Kongs we get so it has not</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ring, while on the smaller side for a 90lb boxer mix, still performs up to task. He's a power chewer and can destroy most toys within minutes. However, this one he either isn't really trying or it holds up that well. It is a little small to use for tug of war without putting my hand in (unintentional) harm's way. But overall, it's one of his favorite toys and we are both pretty happy with it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Kong toys are the go to toys in our house. The dog seems to enjoy most of them. The ring toy she will chew on for a few minutes but quickly becomes bored with it. Not my favorite either. For an intense chewer the choices are limited it has held up well though.Most toys only last a day or two and this one like other Kong toys has been a task for her to destroy. She has not succeeded in chewing it up.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog Lucy loves this chewy ring.  She growls at it, throws it in the air, and catches it, then runs all around the living room rug with it.  Sometimes I think it's calming for her to sit and chew on.  She's a power chewer and this ring holds up really well against her sharp chompers!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My beagle pup did not care for this toy at all. As hard as I tried to get her engaged with the toy she didn’t care for it. It seems sturdy and resistant but I think it’s too expensive for a dog having no interest in it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our two-year-old Airedale is crazy about this ring. He is a champion chewer, and the Kong rubber is one of the few materials that can stand up to his jaws and teeth. He also enjoys carrying it around in his mouth and compressing it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought this as a replacement for a similar nylon ring toy we routinely were replacing as it got chewed up and little bits of plastic kept coming off. We worried she would eat the plastic so we’re looking for a similar alternative as she loves the ring toys and has a powerful chew. Luckily Kong had this and it had been working wonderfully since! It’s a similar rubber to the classic Kong dispenser toy and can withstand our pups chew sessions with no damage.

Also love that we have peace of mind now with her not having to swallow and little pieces by mistake!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy was a little smaller than expected, but that's my fault for not checking the dimensions in the listing. I got the small/medium one for my little 5 lbs dog. I definitely wouldn't give this to a medium sized dog, despite the small/medium size description. 15-20 lbs would probably be the largest size dog I would consider giving this to.
It's made out of the same sturdy rubber other red Kong toys, so it should work well for mild-moderate chewers. I wouldn't give this to a hardcore chewer however as it probably wouldn't hold up.

I purchased a large and thought it would be a good size for my 6 month old puppy. She chews through everything. It is a great toy but to small. I will purchase again in a extra large.

One of my dogs is a big chewer - the other doesn't chew on anything at all, including this bone - but I love this for my strong-jawed chewer. He'll take a chew toy down to nothing, and with real bones, this can get frightening. He manages to splinter them into shards that are worrisome. He's unable to do that with this compressed toy bone made from antler (he has loved the antler chews, but again, he makes shards out of them). It does take him quite a few weeks, if not months, to wear one of these down, and I think we're on the 4th one now, and he chews on it daily. I did also buy the Petstages chew that is compressed wood, and he sometimes chews on</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This product seemed perfect, but was not up to standards. I was super disappointed with how much of the plastic was so easily shed off by my dog chewing on it. He is a lab, but he’s only 50lbs and he only has 1 front leg, so there’s only so much damage he can actually do at his size. He also has vomited up small pieces he chewed off this bone which he has never done with any other bone he has ever chewed. Suuuuuper dissatisfied with this bone.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We've tried a variety of chew toys including nylone bones, bumpy dinosaur shaped chews etc. This one my puppy actually likes. She is supposed to be teething soon so hopefully she'll ha e a few more teeth to gnaw on this with soon because it's very tough material. I'm glad I got it on sale. I wouldn't have bought it at full price because it's a gamble what my dog will actually like.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a 10 month old lab mix powerchewer/shredder. He destroys all his toys. We tried Nylabones but he could take them or leave them. He likes real sticks but eats the wood in copious amounts (not good for obvious reasons). As soon as I opened the package, it grabbed his attention and quickly became his favorite toy; it keeps him busy like nothing else has done. He’s finally happy having something to safely attack, and so are we.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My PitBull loves her chew toys!  8 yrs. old and still chewing toys like when she was a year old.

I think it'll be one of the few toys that will last her the rest of her life!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The durability of this bone was good.  Held up for over a month with our Rottie pup who loves to chew.  But was super disappointed in that it left a big glob of the shredded pieces on her back molars that we had to scrape off.  All the little pieces she shredded off the bone collected in the back of her mouth and stuck like glue. We will not be buying this particular bone again.  :(</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Super disappointed every time I order these they keep going up in price.

You have to make sure you get the right size for your dog because that will make a huge difference in durability. I buy the small for the maltese and I get the XL for my am. bully and and it's lasted against the bully's LOVE and obsession of chewing.

My dog loves rawhide but as he has gotten older and bigger it is harder to find rawhides that last. He is a year old and only 55 lbs, and a medium sized rawhide bone used to last him a few days.  Now they are gone within one sitting. It has just become too expensive to maintain his rawhide habit.  I was pleasantly surprised that this chew bone - armed with two little rawhide rings - kept him occupied as long as it did.  The rings lasted about 10 - 15 minutes, and then he played/chewed on it for maybe another 5-10 minutes - long enough to let us eat dinner in peace.  Given what I was paying for rawhide bones this is a tremendous value</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this toy because some one recommended it and oh my goodness i am glad I bought it my dogs love it so much I might have to buy more of them</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs seem to like these toys, but be aware that the size ""small"" for this is not the same ""small"" as other Busy Buddy Toys and requires a smaller treat disc.

He likes it once he gets started but he’s not quite sure exactly what to do with it. And he hasn’t figured out how to chew on the bone and not just the discs.

She's a moderate chewer and I'm buying a replacement just now after 6 months (disclaimer: they've really gotten me through most of her puppy teething as she's 9 months old now).

Well he loved it but in less than 5 minutes he had chewed off big chunks which were laying all over the couch and could be choking hazards!  He's never done this with any of his other chews before.  This chew is a big no from me and had to be pitched.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pittie/GSD mix loves the original Dogwood stick, so I knew she'd go nuts for the Mesquite flavor. She loved it, but unlike the original, this Mesquite version seems to crumble and break off much more easily. She must have ingested quite a bit the first and only time she chewed it, because she woke up early this morning and vomited the most I've ever seen her throw up. Sure enough, all the reddish brown pieces were there in her vomit, and later that day, in her #2.

He's out of the phase where he demolishes every thing he put his mouth on - thank goodness!! But he never chewed up one of the Dura-squeak balls - They're pretty tough or maybe it was because he loved them so much.

Without them he goes</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We were gifted a toy almost identical to this (purchased from a chain pet store) about 5 years ago when our oldest dog was a puppy. She didn't chew on it a lot so it was still intact when we got our new puppy a year ago. He is a very aggressive chewer and the original toy held up for an entire year.

He loves to play with it and fetch it.  The squeaker doesn't last long but our dog still enjoys it.  It's better than a tennis ball because the lint from a tennis ball would bother our dog.

My big boy loves his new toy and would recommend this to his fellow tough chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog LOVES this chew toy!!  It was just delivered this afternoon and he hasn't put it down yet.  I have never seen him so excited for a toy/chewie.  I am thrilled and in awe.  My dog is 55 lbs and I purchased the medium size.  He has devoured other chew toys and stuffed toys within minutes.  This one looks like it will be lasting a while.  Highly recommend!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Lolla loves this toy as well &amp; I'm about to order another one because she already nawed at it but being that she's still a puppy who is a chewer, I don't want to take any chances.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Marvel loves this one! It seems like flavor is a hit and she loves the little nubs on the ends, and it's easy to carry around. 
Will buy again when she destroys this one.

They both sniffed it, licked it, and walked a way; and they like chew toys</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is one of three toys that I bought new and gave  to my three PitBulls.  Two out of the three LOVE it.  The third one isn't too thrilled with it, but she usually doesn't chew on these kinds of toys anyway.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Highly recommend this for tough chewers. It holds up well and keeps him occupied for a while. Good value too.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Golden Doodle and Border Collie both love this. They are very strong chewers and strong chew toys are the only toys besides balls that I can give them. They haven't come close to destroying this one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog didn't care for it.  It doesn't seem to have any kind of smell or test.

She has had no interest in this bone whatsoever - it was one of our first buys for her, when we thought she'd need to be kept busy while alone.  But it has very little texture for her to sink her teeth into, and really just feels like the smooth plastic of a fold-out table.  I have tried to entice her by smearing peanut butter onto it, but there is no interest in attempting to actually chew on it.  It's been a waste of money for us.  But will give it to my in-laws who have a younger dog.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 35 pound Australian Shepard/Corgi broke one end off within a day. After that we just kept finding little chucks of this everywhere. Had to throw it away.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We’ve been happy with other Petstages products, but as other reviewers have explained, pieces of this get everywhere when your dog chews it. These also do not last nearly as long as other Petstages chew toys. My lab mix chewed half through it in less than an hour, so I had to take it away from her to prevent her from eating/destroying the whole thing at once. It may be fine for casual chewers, but not for strong, persistent ones.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our German Shepard and American bulldog mixes love these bones. We keep them on hand at all times to occupy the boys. The chew is substantial enough to withstand the 80 pound Shepard’s aggressive efforts yet has a more forgiving firmness than antlers, etc. that our veterinarian advised against after the bulldog broke a molar. NewHide does not present the risk of indigestible rawhide chunks. The bones do shed tiny crumbles, which may be a con for some pet parents, however they vacuum up easily. We are fans of this pet product and have gifted it to other pets in the family.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is what the bone looked like after 48 hours. By 72 hours later, it was a tiny nub. I didn't want my dog to choke or totally swallow it so I tossed it in the garbage. She chews a lot, so if your pup chews heavily, I do not recommend this bone.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 9-year old Havanese/Corgi mix loves this chew toy.  I didn't give it five stars because of the shavings that come off when he's chewing.  Hopefully this is not something that will get in his digestive system and cause issues later down the road. Overall, satisfied.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My lab mix promptly took this bone when I gave it to him and proceeded to carry it around from room to room all morning searching for a place to bury it. He's tried digging in his crate, his bed, and the couch but was ultimately unsatisfied with these options. Finally,he found a crevice between the wall and a storage bin that he slipped the bone into and pushed further in with his nose. He has yet to chew on it but it made for a good mental exercise! He hasn't done this with any other bone before.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Although my dogs loved it the toy only lasted 2 days in my house. It did break into many little pieces I had to vacuum up unlike most of the others I have bought. But was as described and would be more suitable for a more moderate chewer than aggressive.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I do not recommend these bones. I have a doberman and a boxer. Both dogs chewed on the bones some but it made their mouths bleed. The bone is like hard plastic. My dogs chewing on the bone made it have sharp points/edges. I had to throw the bones away after a couple days. These bones are nothing like rawhide.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I thought I'd give this a try too see if this was more durable than the nylabones we usually get for our dog. Hes seemed to like it right away but not 10 minutes in he had those white shavings, everyone is talking about, all over and was starting to choke on them. Needless to say I took it away and tossed it. He's not a super strong chewer either, so I was kind of surprised.  We usually love the toys he gets from Chewy, but I would not reccomend this one.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/petstages-newhide-tough-dog-chew-toy/dp/174930,moderate,chew toys

The dogs were curious with the strobe in the dark, but as hard as they are on toys, the strobe only lasted a few days.  The ball is still in good shape to play, just doesn't light up any more.

Too bad the strobe lasted less than 3 hours of play.  Put it away while still working but pulled it out today and dead.   It's a great concept but they need to come up with something that won't die after such a short time.  They still like the bounce but they also love their other rubber bouncy ball that's a bit cheaper.  Would I buy this again for the little bit of extra money that this costs just to have the lights?

The small size is similar to a puppy-sized Kong – which is perfect because that's what we bought it for originally. We like the Kongs better, for our larger-breed puppy. The pieces at the bottom were meant to make the toy more challenging, but since our pup had really big pieces of kibble, the food wouldn't really come out at all, and then Mars would get bored and give up. I'm guessing with the right size kibble this would be a good choice for some dogs!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a very smart GSP that has these wild bursts of energy. Because of my job I can't always take him on a walk or play fetch with him when he needs it - so I rely a lot on brain toys and games that keep him occupied. What I love about this Busy Buddy is that that the hole has these little stoppers in the bottom that can stop the food from coming right out. My sweet doggo loves figuring out the best way to spin and flip it get the most kibble out!

The loss of one star is due to the strong rubber smell on the product when i received it. It made me a little nervous to give it to my dog right out of the Chewy Box.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">By far the best fill-up and treat dispensing toy I've tried. The design is adorable, but it's also very practical. It takes a good while to get the food out and the rubber is strong, but flexible. Has a slight scent and it's quite interesting how it repels water. My old Kong got moldy quite quickly, despite thorough cleaning, this feature of being water resistant seems like it could help.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought 3 of these after watching a video on YouTube. My 4 Pekingese gave up quickly, couldn't get treats OUT. I tried many snacks that they usually love, but they still gave up. They try, but the treats end up being wasted. The smoking gun was when I stuffed a Vienna sausage in one, and they love Viennas, but could not get it all out, even with part of it already out. Maybe someone can advise if I am doing something wrong or to try something that has worked for them?
Thanks,

in Monroe, North Carolina</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I love this thing! My rottie and lab mix are both power chewers (a jumbo bully is gone in about 5-10 minutes max), and this toy, despite my furry bears' best efforts, is still very much in one piece. No teeth marks, broken pieces, NOT A SCRATCH.  Totally worth every penny!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The hole is smaller compared to the red kong version so it’s harder to get the treats out and i prefer that since it keeps my dog busier longer. It also has like some sort of ribbing on the inside to increase the difficulty. Will definitely buy again once toy is destroyed. It’s still intact a year later tho! And i have a heeler lol</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought this a couple of years ago (at least) and our Dutch Shepherd/Heeler mix LOVES her purple squirrel. She is active and methodical with her play and means to get treats out of this. She will repeatedly pick up and drop/throw this thing to the ground hoping that as it bounces the pieces of treats will fall out.

Our bigger dog (about 55lbs) has occasionally stolen it from her and it has serviced him chewing on it for a decent amount of time as well.

Would recommend to anyone with a strong chewer or an active dog who needs a toy to keep them busy for a bit.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the cutest lil guy to get a fun game of find the treats with my 14 weeks old golden. He loves it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The large size was much bigger than I expected.  I thought it would be about the size of a large Kong.  A better size description would be very large and providing dementions would have been very helpful.  IMO, only very large dogs could get this even partially in their mouth and could get really frustrated working to get the treats inside out</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My toy Australian Shepherd really enjoys playing with this and it keeps her engaged for a long time as she tries to get the treats.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/busy-buddy-squirrel-dude-treat/dp/48831,moderate,chew toys

My dog has only used it a few times so far since he has so many toys but...even though he's a power chewer and toy destroyer he didnt feel the urge to kill the gator! Which is a good thing!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have 2 bulldogs that are serious chewers! Ok, so with this toy they did bite of the nose of the alligator (I knew that would go). I was able to fish it out of their mouth since I knew that was coming. Since then they chew to destroy and nothing is breaking apart.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 6 month old lab destroyed the feet and nose within an hour of me giving it to him.

I would recommend Chewy, just not this product.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The rubber has a very strange scent and taste (it was passed around as a dare at Xmas before given to the dog). He hates having it in his mouth, which stinks because it looks like it would have been a great chew toy if it weren't for whatever is mixed into the rubber formula. Not been impressed with arm&amp;hammer as a pet brand - perhaps they should stick with human products.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have two lab puppies. One 5 month and one 3 1/2 month old. I have trouble finding toys that are durable for both as one is much smaller than the other.

It lasted about ten minutes before the feet, nose, and tail were completely chewed off.

I’m curious if the shape of the gorilla would have been better for our dogs.. Overall, the toy does seem heavy however I’m disappointed in how short lived it was for ours.. Also, just a heads up for anyone sensitive to smells please be aware that there is a strong smell to this toy..</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I really thought this one would withstand my dog but he had the front part ripped off in a matter of a hour. Do not purchase if your dog is a heavy chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs LOVE this toy...but he has lost all 4 legs and we are working on the snout..this toy is only used under supervision and I am constantly picking up pieces.

I have used these bones with my late Jack Russell and Norwegian Lundehund, they all loved them.  I would say they are not long lasting with aggressive chewers.

It was still in perfect shape in spite of us throwing it for her probably thousands of times, and her pouncing on it, chewing it, and prancing around with it.  It is by far her favorite toy - she never gets tired of chasing it.  It bounces, squeaks and rolls, and when it bounces or rolls, you never know which direction it is going which is what I think makes it so interesting to her.  I wish Kong made more toys.  They are the only things durable enough for this dog!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">my dog is not only in love with this toy but she is obsessed with it, in particular this square one, she has so many other toys but only ever wants this one!

We play fetch with it every day and every time she brings it back to me we play a little tug of War, so it takes its fair share of abuse and stands up well. It's really bouncy which makes it fun for her to chase and jump up in the air to catch. I also like that the rubber material is easy to clean. It gets dirty in the yard and all I have to do is rinse it off for her to play with it safely</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I purchased because of Kong reputation for recently adopted a 10 month old 49lb puppy who is a chewer.

Sadly, she was banned from them due to her age and the impact on her teeth so now we've had to find alternatives to hard bones.  This is a very sturdy toy BUT it has two layers, an outer layer, and an inner layer.  She pulled the outer layer off in about 10 minutes and tried to eat it.  She is now left with an inner layer that is firm but squishy, like a hard air-filled ball,  and she has not been able to destroy it even though she tries to chew off the nubbins.  I have to say, Kong for the win.  We got the yellow and turquoise square-shaped one for large dogs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 6 month old puppy chewed the pink balls off within minutes. Cute toy.

The yellow ring on the rope toy was broken and discarded in no time, and the middle toy in this picture is so small I can't imagine a pup it would suit. The top ""pinecone"" toy is ok. So... one useful toy out of three for $9 is what we're left with.  Not worth it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 6 lb Yorkie liked the toys but destroyed each one in less than 1 week. No durable enough. The knots on the rope came undone and I had to throw the ring away because I worried she would choke on it. She pulled the strings from the bumpy blue one straight out. She has a few other toys, even plushies and these are the only ones she's destroyed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Puppies love these!  These will keep your pup busy for hours.  I gave this to my puppy every time he tried to bite on me since he is teething and it worked like a charm.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This variety pack is the perfect pack to figure out what kind of teethers your puppy will like. We got this for our 3 month old 6 lb puppy &amp; he enjoys all 3. These are great for toy or small dogs with tiny mouths. 

We freeze the plush fabric toy, &amp; it’s held up well against sharky puppy teeth punctures. Both the pliable rubbery toy and rope toy are also intact although I wouldn’t recommend these for a heavy tugger, the yellow ring on the rope can easily slide off, as can the fabric knot inside the blue rubbery toy. 

I’ve used Petstages toys for my previous dog 12 years ago, &amp; the brand continues to make quality products. Would love it if Chewy carried even more of their toys.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/petstages-mini-dental-triple-pack/dp/46976,moderate,chew toys

It is just difficult enough to challenge her when she gets bored but she is able to get all the treats out by herself (I use the Nutro Crunchy triangular shaped treats).

I cut the pink one up a bit so they come out easier, but it was not easy to slide the edge of the scissors in there.  The pink one can rough up a finger and my BC x GR is a licker usually when trying to get treats/kibbles out of toys like this, so no doubt she hurt her tongue trying to fit it though.  ~*~ I haven't bought more than these two, so can't say for sure if all pink ones </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 6 month old 5 pound puppy looooooves this toy.

It's hard to find toys that hold her attention for very long.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I think this treat will be a bit better for my dog when the weather is warmer and I can make it a frozen treat for him. The prongs inside of it make it hard to know at all when a treat will come out (i have cut them shorter). The toy mainly needs to be bounced and thrown for a treat to come out which my dog isn't all that fond of (not much a fetch player) but I will try more with it when it's nicer out and we can use it outside. I'd recommend it more for dogs who are inclined to playing fetch like that but for those more fond of pushing a toy around or chewing/licking there are different toys more geared for that.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Great design and challenging puzzle.

Its very durable for our 78 lb husky mix aggressive chewer. Very few toys can stand up to her powerful chewing. We purchased the largest one. We are using it as a toothbrush chew toy for her. She’s on a special diet so she can’t have the treats that are made for it. We just use her doggy toothpaste on the bristles and give it to her for 10-15 minutes every day. She loves it. It does a really good job cleaning her teeth. There are only a few areas that need a little more work on my part with a finger brush.I love that it all comes apart for easy cleaning too.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog tried this chew toy and lost interest pretty quickly. He is 35 pounds, and the medium I purchased is too large for him. It is also very hard plastic which he doesn't seem to like. The attached treats do not keep his attention. I have a friend whose dog loves his bristle bone, (I gave it extra stars for that) so it's a matter of individual taste, I guess. Not for me and my dog, though.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 55lb Aussie's mouth is not big enough to bite into the center brush area.  He can however, easily pull the treat rings out of brislte bone and eat them seperately and quickly.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this for my 73lb pup (almost a year old) who loves to chew. At first, I gave it to him with the treats. He figured it out and got the treats off relatively quickly (but he's pretty smart if I do say so myself). He loves the toy even without the treat, it is his new favorite. The only downside is that the pieces of ""bone"" that stick out dont hold up well. We have had this for about 1 week and one of the ""ears"" is gone. But he is so excited, and it keeps him stimulated and keeps his teeth clean. Plus, putting the treats in is an added bonus here and there. Whenever he destroys this I will absolutely be getting another! All around win</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is the BEST!!!!! I can not recommend enough. It’s a great size, incredibly durable, AND you can add on new treat rings to keep your pup interested. My dog would not put it down, i think he actually spent over 3/4 hours straight chewing on it the day we received it. It is so so so worth the money. The treat rings are tough to get off, and my pups LOVE the scent/taste of them as well. The best toy ever. I can’t recommend enough</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the second Bristle Bone Dog Toy for our dog. He loves it. I use the rawhide discs with it as well as peanut butter or ‘spray cheese’....cheese in a can..  I am amazed at how much better his teeth look.  He was able to get the end off and chewed the threads on the post. That made it a little difficult to screw it back together.  He has used it so much that I noticed some missing chunks of bristles so I bought a replacement bristle bone toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dogs love these! We get the raw hides that go with them and it keeps them busy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">No one in my house likes the very strong odor of this toy, including my two Goldens.  I ordered one toy for each of them and neither of my dogs will get near it, even with the little rawhide circles installed.  I might have made a different decision about buying them, if the ""scented"" aspect was in the website description.  

Aside from that, it looks really sturdy and is dishwasher safe.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a lab mix and I've tried all kinds of things to keep his teeth tartar-free and thought this would do the trick - brushing while he's having fun! On his third session it ended up in pieces: he'd eaten the good bits and quite a bit of the bits that he ought not to have eaten, leaving the bone in pieces. I'd certainly recommend it for smaller dogs though, and for parental-controlled periods (which I was doing) only.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have both sizes of these toys now and our dogs love them.  Make sure to order the correct size of treats that go on.  They get chewed up, but you can still unscrew them and keep using them for a long time.

The rule of thumb is if you can't bend it with your hands and make an indent with your fingernail on it, it's too hard.

I monitor the bones regularly and it does require me to  trim off any loose chunks of the bone (from aggressive chewing), but well worth the effort and  I think it is a good idea to monitor any chew toy    I feel less worried about my chewer breaking a tooth on these vs a sold hard chew bone.

This has 4 rubber fingers inside the the opening that make it more challenging to get the treats (the directions say you can trim those back if you like, but when you do, there is no going back.)

I ordered a medium and a large, one for each dog and the smaller medium I made the mistake of not chopping the treats in half so now the toy is full stuffed of treats that the poor little dog can’t get out and he’s getting very ticked. I tried cutting the prongs and thumping it and squeezing and I can’t even get them out. My mistake. The large size is difficult but after thumping they eventually come out. Had I chopped the treats into smaller pcs it could have been a fun toy. I’ll have to pitch the smaller one if he ever gets away from it. My bad. So just make sure not to put too large of treats in it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I trimmed the prongs like it stated to for easier access to the treats, but my pup still just doesn’t like the toy itself.

We have two super tough chewers in our home- a 110# rottie/lab mix and a 70# shepherd/pyr puppy. 

We have struggled to find a toy that lasts even 5 minutes in our home. Nothing seems to work until we got this one!! It took about 6 months before they started to pull off rubber chunks. The 3-pronged bone is the only one that has lasted that long, some of the other toys from this brand were torn up within a day or two but this one lasted for a looooong time :) 

Tough rubber but soft too so the dogs are actually interested in it unlike kong toys. Hollow inside so you can add treats or peanut butter! 

Definitely recommend!!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My German Shepherd destroys most toys within the first hour.  She loves this toy! It is kinda heavy. I fill it with peanut butter and she will lick on it and stick her immensely long tongue all the way to the bottom to get the last drop. I swear it's like she's sucking on a pacifier when she gets to the bottom. It's hilarious.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I just received the two of the toys today, and the puppy has been chewing on it for approximately 45 minutes and has already chewed a chunk off. Might be ok for light to moderate chewers, she definitely liked it but it didn't last.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I dont recommend it for Strong chewers.  My lab  has chewed off pieces of it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a 47 pound mix who is a super chewer. This toy is such a tough rubber that it looks almost new after months of play. It is quite heavy but that doesn’t bother me or my dog any. The holes in each end are a decent size to hold a bunch of apple chunks or treats and acts as an interactive toy for my pup to try to get them out. An overall great buy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I would compare this to a KONG and I use in similar fashion by smearing a bit of peanut butter in one or all of the opening as a treat.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Took my dog about 20 minutes to be pulling big red rubber chunks off of the ends of this toy. So, while it may be okay for less strong chewers - it didn't stand up well to my strong chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Active Frenchie LOVES it. It’s durable and easy to clean</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog loved the toy when it came out of the package, and immediately proceeded to chip the tough plastic and break off pieces.
He plays with it periodically since we bought it couple of weeks ago.

This toy has held up better than any other chew toy and it is soft so it doesn't hurt his teeth but still exercises his chaws and teeth.

My collie who normally destroys his toys after 2 days, hasn’t been able to cause any damage to this :)

I had a hard time getting treats into this and when they fell in too far, I had a harder time getting them out and my dogs couldn't get them out at all.  However...that kept them very busy trying!

This chew toy is pretty durable and is getting chewed up but very slowly.  I would buy again - which I will have to since no toy is indestructible for my dog!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dachshund loves this.

It's my dog's favorite toy. I got the Medium size for my 35lb labradoodle.

He sniffs, licks, gnaws, and tosses it, and will stop doing almost anything if I tell him to go find it. Over time, he has been able to gnaw a few chunks off, but he's usually so interested in the treat inside that he just spits them out. He loves it so much, I'm planning to buy a few just in case they change the model or discontinue it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">That’s how long this was whole. I want to love it - it bounces, hold treats, cool color - but pup was ripping into it within the first half hour, so no joy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 50 pound whippet mix with jaws of steel. He likes toys he can rip apart best, but I can't afford to support that lifestyle. This bone is perfect for him. It is tough enough that he can't tear it up in 10 min., but gives enough that he can still get some peices off here and there. Best of both worlds. Bonus: you can put treats in the center!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our very energetic dog loves this toy. She is intrigued by the milk  bones tucked in the ends.

Even this one, which I really thought would be the best fit. Had it been I would have purchased many more. My dog took it and right away started chewing on it, the corners, the center and even picked it up but then sat down and started ripping pieces off the toy, so not so tough. She’s only 2 years old. The search continues.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is one of the best toys I have found for my 2 dogs (Great Dane &amp; Catahoula). It entertains for hours, as it takes a long time to work the treat out of the toy. The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 star is that the first time I left it for them to chew on while at work I came home to find it had come unscrewed (not sure how this happened since I turned it really tight when I put the treat in it) and they had chewed on the stem of the part you screw into the other half. Fortunately I am still able to screw it together! WHEW! And they have not unscrewed it since, but I have not left it for them all day long either. Overall, I would DEFINITELY recommend this as a tough and enjoyable chew</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy has a horrible chemical smell to it that doesn’t go away so I know my dog must taste it as she keeps leaving the toy.

It’s difficult to pick a toy for him that is not too easy, not too hard, not too nobby or bristly.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have 2 dogs, and they both were really into this cute toy---for a while.  I got the refill rings to go with it, and they were interested only when there was a ring on it.  Predictable, I guess, but my 2 got those rings off in record time!

Now the Woofer dog toy lays lonely on the floor.  Until, I'm sure, I place another ring on it.  

Overall, I liked the idea, but in reality, my dogs weren't that crazy about it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog chewed it in half unless than an hour. Not good for a giant breed as advertised. Not worth it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The Busy Buddy makes alone time for our Hank a lot easier with a lot less destruction. He's a super chewer pittie pup, and this toy holds up to his power jaw. The treats are thick, but they last several uses for him since he can't get it unscrewed anymore (he chewed on that piece after the first use, so it holds even tighter now).

I would recommend this toy and brand overall.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a Husky, Shepard, Wolf mix.

So much so that they will argue over it and I’ve had to start buying two at a time!!
The only thing is because they love on it so much they whittle it down to nothing pretty fast and we have to really watch for when it gets to small so we can throw it out because I’m afraid it will get stuck in their throats. Also, pick it up every night, this is worse than stepping on a lego!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our new German Shepherd pup wanted to chew every stick and rock in the yard so I hoped this would meet her need to chew and be so much healthier.

She did choose it over another bone that I had but it had pieces coming off of it in less than a day or two. To make sure she's not swallowing &amp; gets hurt I had to take it away from her.

He chased it, pounced on it, and then proceeded to spend the next 45 min chewing on it! Longest he's sat in one place with a toy before. We've had it for 4 days and each morning he goes to look for it. The 3 level chubby kong and other toys are abandoned, he is going for this. I stick a treat in it once in a while and he has to really work to get it out- he loves it. Easy to carry around, not too heavy, and he can chew to his heart's content.

Only downside is it is a little small but she still loves it. Not even a dent in it and she's had it for a couple weeks.

I purchased this Large KONG tire expecting they would have a great time with a new toy.

My 60 plus dog doesn’t quite know what to do with it. It was a replacement for one about 6”.

I purchased the MED/LG size tire. It's smaller than expected however it's perfect because he is petite for his breed. Keep in mind no toy is indestructible. He has managed to nibble bits off of his Kong Extreme ball (see picture), little by little however it has taken him about a year to do so and he gnaws on it 24/7. He's happy to know that a new ball is expected to arrive with his next auto shipment, he loves delivery day!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Although smaller than I thought the girls love this toy. Since then, I actually found some that were larger and has a pull rope, which is great for two pups.  This is one toy they did not tear up.

If other food toys are out smarted or destroyed by your dog- BUY THIS ONE!

My Aussie/heeler outsmarts or destroys most of the “interactive toys” much to my wallet’s dismay. The last food ball I bought she would roll around her bolster bed instead of the floor. With her other food toys she’ll hold them and unscrew them. 

This toy has officially outworked her. SCORE!

The toy is bottom heavy making it easy to fill and making the dog actually work for the food. They have to bobble or push it to get any food. It is made of a plastic that is hard and durable but not brittle. 

This toy is not obnoxiously loud on hard floors like many others. (If your dog can throw it</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I wanted to give it 5 stars. It is a great products and perfect for a busy dog. We got the large one for our sheepadoodle puppy and it took him a little while to figure it out. Although when he did it only took him a few minutes to clear it out. We feed him lunch in it most days to get some of his energy out and he loves it. If you have a smart dog as soon as they learn how it works it won’t take much. I’d give it 5 stars if it took him longer to clean out, maybe when we switch to adult dog food where the pieces are a little bigger.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 50lb Catahoula girl absolutely loves it! She is crazy about food, and can eat all of her food from a slow feeder bowl in under two minutes. With this, it takes her about 15 minutes to completely empty it. She has more difficult food/treat dispensing toys but that take her longer, but I like that I can fit her whole meal in this and not have to refill it. Heavy chewers should not be left alone with it though. she doesn't chew on it other than to pick it up and move it, and after a week the top is pretty cut up. It'd be easy for her to take a chunk out of the plastic if she wanted to.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Keeps my crazy lab busy during breakfast and dinner. I usually split his kibble portion in half in his slow feeder and feed him in his wobbler kong outside to keep him busy. The kong is huge so if you have a big dog, get the large. My lab thought this was a toy and started to chew on the top, but eventually figured out that it dispenses treats/kibble. It's entertaining watching him use his nose and paws to get the treats out of the toy. Definitely would recommend this to prolong feeding times and also keep you pup mentally and physically stimulated.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my third slow feeder, and I actually love this one (and so does my pup). All the martial is a hard plastic and the bottom screws off for easy, thorough cleaning. The opening in the side is large enough for the large pieces of kibble to easily fall out without getting jammed, but still requiresb our pup to put in some effort to get his food.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our big boy figured this toy out quickly and can’t get enough of it! It’s larger than I expected but I don’t mind and neither does he. We get a larger kibble so usually only 3-4 pieces max fall out at once, which slows mealtime down nicely. He doesn’t give up till he’s got every bit out. It’s a pretty firm plastic, unlike most kong chew toy types, but there’s no edge for him to really try and chew except for the hole for the treats. He hasn’t been able to break it and he’s a power chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This unscrews to place the treats inside. We had one years ago and our dogs ignored it. Not so with our newest Dane/Mastiff. Not only is she occupied for long periods with this, but she manages to get it unscrewed no matter how tight we screw it together. A true joy to watch her struggles.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This Kong is awesome! When you need some time to decompress after a long day,  this toy will keep you baby busy!

Within the 10 minutes of giving it to him it ended up scattered across the whole house in little pieces.

I also think this is one of the best options for heavy chewers since neither of my dogs were able to break pieces off of it like their other bones.

This is the ONE artificial bone that they love. I have tried several nylabones and other brand bones and they have little to no interest in those, but they absolutely LOVE these. (The deerhorn by this brand is a close second, but they don't care for the wood ones, even though they love real sticks.) They hold up well.

The dogs enjoyed them but obviously they can’t get out the hammered in bully sticks so they presently aren’t suiting our need but will keep looking for a perfect product for the middle. Too expensive to give up on these but honestly  if they were cheaper I probably would call it a loss and donate them.

It seems like these toys are indestructible.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This keeps my dog occupied longer than a frozen Kong. I put a medium sized whimzee about half way in it and then add some nutro crunchy treats and mini milkbones. I seal the end and side holes with PB. My dog figured out quick that as soon as she got the PB off the bigger hole of a kong that she could just pick it up and drop it and the treats would fall out. We give her one of these in the morning when we go to work and she usually has the whimzee finished but has not gotten all the small treats out inside. Really good puzzle toy. They’re also dishwasher safe so they’re super easy to clean!

I have had many toys for him over the years and had my doubts at first but this has become my go to toy for him and I have recommended it so many times now to other people. It is the longest lasting toy he has ever had. It does get full of teeth marks after a while and sometimes small pieces may come off but he doesn’t bother with them and they are small. Overall it stays in tact and lasts a very long time. I always make sure I have a spare to switch out when it gets rough looking. He loves this toy. It is worth a try if you are looking to entertain your powerful chewer!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We LOVE west paw!

I have to buy a new one every 3/4 months but I will do it forever. Big fan of this thing!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Great product, we tear up one jerky treat and slide it in the grooves and this makes a regular treat last 30 minutes or longer versus if he had it alone. He mostly disregards it when there's no food in it but that's not when we use it. Comparable to a kong, but the dog has to work harder for this.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My bully mix loved this toy - absolutely obsessed with it. It lasted about three days before he started pulling chunks off of it. 
It is a great toy for treats but I wouldn't recommend it for tough chewers, especially unsupervised.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We buy West Paw because they are the only toy to withstand our chewers in fostering.

The small size is too small for bully stick though so that's a bummer. But I would imagine it's too challenging for dogs to get it out even if the bully stick can fit in. I tried small kibbles of dry food and larger training treat, both work great. The greenie dental treat however is too challenging and he gave up. My friends got the toy for their labs and they gave up too soon. Not for my boy hahaha. I guess it depends on how food-driven the dog is.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is mainly a chihuahua and pit bull mix (picture inserted below to know the exact mixture) But she absolutely loves this toy! I inserted two natural antlers that I found cheap at Marshall’s! (because she tears through the bully sticks I had put in there!!) these last a while and they keep her occupied so I can do something for about an hour at a time. I also never leave it out...

Moving the stick back out can be a challenge, but I've found success with a couple things: pushing the stick out from the other side with the handle end of a wooden spoon (like a stinky push pop) and also grabbing the dry bully stick with a pair of pliers and pulling it out while gently twisting the qwizl. Takes some work, but it's worth it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have an AST, and she has had the same west paw full-size Quizl for over two years with barely a dent.

I had filled it with treats, sealed with peanut butter and froze it.  I gave it to him in his crate while I was away from home for less then two hours.  When I came back, yes he had eaten all the treats, but he had also almost eaten off the top to this!  He is only three months old.  The kongs of old would have lasted far longer. I have used them for years with both dogs and puppies and never had one that was chewed apart so quickly.
I will be loooking for alternatives to Kong.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I really wanted to like this item.  It seems to be a good size shape with a large opening and little nubs for grip, however, my puppy did a number on it after only a handful of uses.  The Kong version holds up so much better.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">A friend adopted a young dog and the dog was having some separation anxiety.I gave this to her as a gift and she tells me that she adds the cheese in the center and gives this to her and shes so busy that she doesn't notice her mom leave.Its turned into one of her favorite toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We always struggle to find something strong for Martha and her teeth. She would go through toys like it was nothing. She doesn’t play with it as much as I thought she would but I put peanut butter in it and she likes to get her treat out of it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Nubbins on the medium were a bit larger than anticipated, but the dogs teeth are cleaner so I guess it's ok. If you've got a double coated constantly shedding breed, the nubbins will collect hair. Easily washed off with hot water and a bristle brush.
Hole on bottom was a bit smaller than I'd like. Makes getting stuck &amp; going funky stuff out an enrichment activity for humans. 
The big issue? The sizing noted for the product. ""6.75 inches long by 5 wide at the bottom by 3 inches wide at the top"" (given by a Chewy rep in the answered questions) for a medium is absolutely incorrect. More like 4"" L X 2.5"" W at bottom and 1.5"" W at top.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">That toy stopped the arguments between my little guy and my daughters big brute 
Now that we have 2 just like kids they tell each other I’m not playing with mine but don’t you look at mine or touch it it’s funny too watch keeps them busy</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I gave this to my hound mix and within five minutes it is torn up. What a waste.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog destroys most toys within hours.  Cloth based or stuffed toys last an hour tops.  Rubber based toys usually last a day if they're lucky.  I'm happy to say that this thing has lasted about a week so far.  My dog has bit off and destroyed the smaller ""ball"" portion of the toy and is actively working on pulling off the rubber from the rest of it, but the toy is fighting back with all it's got and doing it's best to hold it's shape.  Not sure I'd buy this again. The Kong version of this has lasted longer and seems more durable.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">As soon as they arrived I washed them and stuffed them with chicken and a couple other goodies.  Instant entertainment for my 2 very large dogs.  Kept them entertained for hours.  Very helpful when I'm trying to work from home!  My dogs destroy toys in minutes, but not these.  I have another one that's at least 4 years old and still going!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’m very pleased with the quality of this toy! It’s very similar to Kong but it almost feels more sturdy. I put my dogs kibble in his small sized kong and it doesn’t hold very much, so I ordered this in a medium. It’s bigger then I expected but that’s ok! I can fit his full breakfast serving of food in here and I can also do pieces of carrot sticks or other treats as a boredom buster. I haven’t tried any of the stuff and free recipes but I may order some of the small sizes and do that.

Within 5 minutes, my 11 month old Black Lab had pieces of rubber all over the floor. He is a chewer, not aggressivevly so, just a normal chewer for a big dog. I am returning this toy. Not up to the reviews.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought the orange one.

This is about the first toy that our smaller dog (45#) hasn’t been able to “eat”.  Terrier-Cattle dog mix and can chew through everything - until now!

Yes pricy but worth it!  Since this one has done so well we plan on getting the larger GoughNuts..  It’s also great for two dogs - awesome tug toy, the other dog is 100 pounds and between the two of them this GoughNuts has held up remarkably.

*another great thing about this toy, it bounces big time!  Will bounce in all directions throwing your dog off as to what direction it will go after bounced - fun to watch them get confused.

I should have been more careful.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I didn't read the instructions when I purchased this, BUT the dogs love it and they tug with it! Only once in awhile to they sit and chew on it. One girl weighs 94 and the other is about 100, while the 15 month old male is 110 and the 4 year old male is 135.  They chew like they mean it, and these GoughNuts toys really stand up to the test of time! Honestly. I have the long round ones that are shaped like a hotdog purchased several years ago.  Still going strong. Other brands I have had to throw away. Most of the Kong toys also last. Always READ the instructions!! See which type of dog should or shouldn't have the toy. My Mastiff/Lab pups are not the same as a Shih Tzu pup at 4 months.  Do that</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Another good choice for a chew toy!

In the past, we have been going through 2 Kong’s in about a month before we had had to switch to new ones. However, the last set that we got only lasted about a week before big chunks started coming off. Therefore I do not know if it was a bad manufacturing batch or if the company has decided to use an inferior rubber compound. Hoping it gets corrected quickly or going to have to look for another product.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 1.5, almost 2 year old pitbull who shreds anything and everything and this toy is amazing. I have gotten every “indestructible” and “made for pits” toy I can find and nothing ever takes her longer than 3 minutes to totally destroy. This toy took about three months to even get a tooth mark in it and now I have had it about a year and it still isn’t destroyed. I think it makes her more mad that she can’t destroy it making her try harder. This is great.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered 2 large kongs to replace the ones I purchased 2 years ago that are now tearing apart (to be expected). However, these are much smaller! Large used to be 5 inches, now they are 4 in apparently. I have been buying these for 7 years now and they are smaller everytime. Also, I paid $9 each for them last time ... now the large is $14 and xl is $20. Thats insane. If it weren't for the insistence from my dogs to have pb kongs every night I may not bother to buy them again. This is super frustrating. I know most if not all of this is controlled by kong, not chewy but still aggravating. I have requested to return and replace them with the larger size. So,don't pay attention to the weight on </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My German Shepherd is 11 years old. We refer to his Kong as his pacifier! He absolutely knows where it is all the time. He used to carry it almost everywhere. About two years ago, I threw it and the smallest top section went flying in another direction. After probably 8 years (?) that piece had looked like it was dry rotting and I guess it was. I think this is a great quality product especially for keeping a large dog engaged and able to chew something they can’t destroy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">No toy is indestructible but haven't had a problem with Kong Extreme. There's teeth marks but there hasn't been any torn off pieces unlike similar toys from other brands. They have a unpredictable bounce which makes for a great fetch toy. There's a hole on top and you can knot a rope and turn it into a tug toy. Depending how you stuff it/freeze it, it also becomes a food puzzle toy with varied difficulties.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Toy Fox Terrier is 1 1/2 years old and chews on EVERYTHING.  I purchased this with hopes it would be small enough and yet big enough not to be distroyed.  She loves carrying it around in her mouth and we pay fetch with it.  I can't imagine this would ever wear out but if it does, I'm purchasing a replacement.  Wonderful durable toy for those sharp jaws.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Kongs are great. I was a little worried my large hound would chew through this since he likes to chew some of my handmade wood furniture, but he hasn't yet destroyed this Kong and I've had it (I think) about a month now. Before I leave for work, the dogs each get a Kong filled with whatever dog-safe food I want to get rid of mixed with some peanut butter and/or dog treats. Glad I made the purchase!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We had a black Kong extreme that lasted over 3 years.  My golden doodle finally worked it enough where the smaller end came off.  I’ve purchased 3 in the last 5 months and they are only lasting 2 months each now. The only thing I can assume is Kong changed the material. He’s not an aggressive chewer but I would like them to last more than 2 months.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I am extremely disappointed with this product. This little 9lb ChiPoo pictured is very destructive when it comes to any type of toy. With this in mind I got the highest degree of strength (extreme) thinking that would deter her from breaking it... However she was able to completely break this toy in under 20 minutes. She was able to do this not once but twice (I ordered two toys, one for each dog of mine) in under 20 minutes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My twin puppies destroy everything but Kong’s.

The pieces were small enough that I did not suspect that she was doing so much damage so quickly, but what she threw up was the pinkish/orange color of the bone.

It provides some much needed mental stimulation for my 6 month Dalmatian puppy and she LOVES it! She will carry it from room to room with her to chew on. She loves the everlasting treat inserts but they only last maybe two days with an hour or two of chewing per day. Also by the end she can usually get out a big hunk of treat at a time and I worry that she doesn’t chew it enough so I hope it’s easily digestible! The bonus is that you can shove additional treats in the bottom. I like to put frozen carrots or blueberries in the bottom so she really has to work to get them out. Keeps her entertained even longer than the insert treats! So overall a really good treat ball,</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have 3 big dogs and bought these hoping the would chew them...that they did and got them out of the holder within a couple minutes! Was hoping they would do the normal and chew; one did but she even busted the rubber and got the middle ""everlasting chew"" out and then chowed down on it. They love it so i gave 2 stars but definitely not worth the $ if you're dog is a motivated dog or a huge chewer when it comes to something like a treat. This is maybe an hour after we got it...the rubber outside didn't hold up either! They got them discs out of the rubber and gone!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I gave this to my 45 lb puppy with some kibble in the treat side and the treat that came with the bento ball in place. She LOVES it! She's been working on it for a little over an hour - and the treat is about half done, but she already tore one side of the ball out so she could just gnaw on the treat.

Disappointing, since she doesn't like chewing hard toys, so I thought this could work for more than one use.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loved this toy, and the treat was a good dental chew. However, on the third or fourth day of giving it to him, I looked over and saw he had eaten a large chunk of the rubber (see photo below). He's a strong chewer for sure, but he is under 35 pounds, so this toy should not be advertised as virtually indestructible or for strong chewers. If you've got a dog that isn't quite as strong, though, this toy would be excellent for them for hours of entertainment.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was worried that my 100+ lb shredder pupper would destroy the rubber as others reviewed. However, after seeing one of these bad boys at my friends place (with 7 crazy dogs), I decided to invest in one.  No damage has been done! My other concern was if my dog would even like the treat that it came with (he is spoiled and picky with new things). At first I paired the everlasting treat with some of his Rachael Ray’s Soup bones (stored it in the other side). He didn’t seem to like it at first. Then I decided to rinse off any possible residue on the top of it first. Now I have to monitor how long he has a treat for. He will go at it until he’s out of breath and tired. This treat could’ve probably</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">At first I was kinda worried seeing as other dogs have taken chunks from this toy. My Oakley is a very big chewer and I wanted something to deter him from chewing my clothes, or jumping up against the counter, and trying to take stuff that isn’t his. As soon as I pulled this out of the packaging I haven’t seen him go for anything he’s not supposed to. Will be getting some replacement treats for this toy because he’s loving it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I purchased my first Bento Ball from my local pet boarding/daycare facility. Was told is would last for a long time to help with boredom. Mi Mini Goldendoodle had it eaten within about a hour. 
I thought I’d get a different one and maybe it would last. And it lasted about 2 hours. 
Of course that is longer but was not as long as described. No way it would last 6-8 hours. The holder would be destroyed by then. I will continue to use them but wish it was a little more sturdy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Bloodhound Ellie loves this toy! Whenever I put in a new treat it's her go to toy keeps her occupied for about 15 to 20 minutes (which is really good for her). I have filled with the Starmark Everlasting Chicken with the rounded top, but I've used the other chicken flavored and the ridged one as well. She loved them too I just order the liver one to see if she likes it as well.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this because my dog loves to chew. It is advertised to be indestructible but my dog determined that false. This was after only having it about 30 minutes. The rubber casing around the bone part is actually pretty soft compared to normal chewers. One the rubber part is messed up the bone part becomes pointless. I don’t think it’s a terrible toy but I do think it is marketed falsely, not everlasting, and didn’t last “hours”, “virtually indestructible” false!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We adopted a 9 year old beagle pup in January, and quickly learned that he didn't really know how to play. He doesn't understand fetch, and doesn't really like to chew anything that's not food. However, I wanted to find something to keep him busy when we aren't outside enjoying a walk. This toy fit's the bill! Our pup isn't really interested in licking the large treat, but he loves pushing the ball around with his nose trying to get smaller treats out. He's gotten so good at it that it only takes him a few minutes to get every last bite out! I wished it lasted a bit longer, but I'm just happy he's excited about a toy!</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/starmark-everlasting-treat-bento-ball/dp/45443,extreme,chew toys

I specifically looked for a extreme chew type of toy that my 9 month old golden doodle would be able to use a few times at the minimum. However, after less than 15 minutes, it was already destroyed.

They are heavy chewers, and they haven’t been able to chew through this. However, this particular toy seems to “shed” or flake easily as they chew it, and then I find these little Nyla-pieces stuck EVERYWHERE (carpet, throw blankets, etc.) We have many different Nylabones, and I don’t notice it as much with the other styles. I’m not sure if it’s simply due to this color being more obvious or if it’s truly unique to this bone, but it can definitely be a mess.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">You can chew it no matter which angle.  It is a nice one when the dog has to be in a cone because they don't really have to hold on to it</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a fantastic chew, especially for the price. Our German Shepherd loves it. Another perk - It is a whole lot easier for humans to see since it doesn’t lay flat on the ground.

Well, they did a good job of keeping him occupied and he'd chew these fairly regularly.  At one point, I ran one under the faucet and then threw it into the freezer for a few hours before giving it to him.  The coldness seemed to help, too.

I bought the second because I figured that the larger one would last longer, but I was wrong. The red plastic is softer and they work on that section until the bone snaps. Then they chew on the nubs of the red middle part until it is confiscated.

This really stands the test of time!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My boys bickered over this toy non-stop! It was an absolute hit. Unfortunately it was in two within a month, and small red plastic pieces were being torn off. The red ""center part"" is softer than the white Nylabone ends and that's the part that failed. Because they loved it so much, I am contemplating getting another, but I'm going to investigate other toys first.  If your dog isn't a super-aggressive chewer, then I'd recommend.

He takes it everywhere and chews on it constantly. It’s very durable. my dog is a big chewer and we’ve had it several month now and it has yet to break.

Unfortunately, once our Golden couldn't figure out how to get more treat out, he started ripping on the tire ridges. I was unsurprised, since, when I opened the package, I thought the tire felt soft, but I did find it surprising considering the marketing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I liked the idea of this toy but my dog didn’t like it. After a a couple days she did eat the treat that came with it. No obvious chewing of the rubber toy though. I replaced the treat and she never touched the toy again.

This is still around and still fun for them. Money well spent on dog toys. Our puppy carries it around the house and our older dog follows her.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this to replace one I have had for a while. Out of the package it had an overly sweet fake vanilla scent. My dog ate up the treat and enjoyed removing it, however, it made him sick to his stomach. He used to bring me the old one all the time hoping for a treat but he hasn’t touched this one since the first night. The treats have never caused a problem before so I am guessing it was whatever was put on the wheel itself to give that smell. I am disappointed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a great idea for a toy but it didn't work out for us. First of all, it smells really bad and the odor is so strong, it has to stay outside. Like fake vanilla. Some folks might like that but I don't. It's so strong it clings to rugs and surfaces. Yuck. One of my two dogs was interested in it as an outside toy for a while but once the ridges got flattened from licking and chewing, she lost interest. Now it's just a stinky neglected piece of rubber hanging around stinking up my yard. Yup, after being outside for several weeks it just keeps on reeking. Next stop, the trash.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this for my bernedoodle. He had it started in pieces within a day. It's now a million tiny pieces. I am only getting toys that say they are ""tough"" but so far, have been sorely disappointed! He's definitely a tough chewer and this did not stand up to his chewing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Just another toy added to the long list of hundreds of dollars spent on toys. Another toy marketed for extreme chewers that lasted my dog all of 30 minutes before the actual rubber itself was shredded. The treat center held up 15. Very disappointed in this toy, and once again I’m on the search for something that will last my dog longer than 2 hours.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My young greyhound attacked this with enthusiasm and kept at it until she worked the treat free. And she ate the whole thing. The replacement treats are a little expensive for me if they only last a half-hour.

I wash it before she uses it again with no problems.  I would give 5 stars but the letters are starting to peel off and she likes to worry at them until they do. She hasn't eaten any (that I can tell, they usually end up on the floor) but I will be throwing this one out soon. It has been 9 months so we have gotten a good amount of use out of it. I will be ordering another for her</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I can see how this line of toys may not work for all dogs' chewing styles, but for mine they have been great! My dogs (boxer mix and shepherd mix) are both 55+ lbs and these have lasted for months. HOWEVER, based on the negative reviews, these may not work if your dog chews to destroy. If they chew to just gnaw a bit on different textures like mine do, these are great.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was one of my pups favorite chew toys until the raised bumps started coming off after chewing. Not as tough as a lot of the Kong toys. I will probably order another, it lasted about 3 weeks before my pup was able to chew off the raised bumps. Seems like it would be a good cleaner for their teeth.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I had high hopes for this toy.  Our 17 pound terrier mix is very particular about what she will chew on, but when she chews on something she really works it over.  Isabel had this toy chewed into small pieces within a few short hours.  she broke the first piece off within 60 mins.  She loved it but it just didn't last.  For the cost I was hoping it would last longer than one evening.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Both of my dogs are power chewers, however one is more so than the other. She managed to chew off the ends in no time at all. I found pieces of plastic all over the house and I found the blue rubber with it. I wouldn't recommend for a power chewer. I also wouldn't recommend this for a dog that likes to eat what they chew instead of just chew it. I had to take one of my dogs to the vet and they found a blockage; part of that blockage was caused by this toy. SO IF YOUR DOG EATS WHAT THEY CHEW ON, DO NOT GET THIS!!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I've purchased this before and it lasted a very long time, I'm sure it's lost around here somewhere.

Not the biggest play toy but she enjoys the variety and flavor/ scents!

The other 2 are goblins and usually lose all their toys immediately, but with these they bring them to bed and back to living room every day, they are their favorite. I will definitely be buying this pack again. I only wish they made a bigger size since my Rottweiler/Pitbull 6 month old almost looks like he's going to swallow it whole sometimes, so we can't leave it in his crate with him while we're at work, just in case.

Which is was I was looking for, since I have a Catahoula Hound puppy. 

Also,  before I ever opened the box it was shipped in the rubber smell was so strong.  Stinky, I can't stand to be in the same room as it, so I tossed it in the yard.

I would like to return it I will see what Chewy's does.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the best tug toy I’ve found by far. We have owned this toy for several months and other than some teeth marks, it’s still going strong. My 2 pit bulls and my Staffordshire/lab mix will play with this toy for hours dragging and pulling each other around. It is heavy. It does smell like rubber. However it does hold up amazingly to abuse from the dogs. I highly recommend for any destructive chewers and fans of tug of war.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">this is one of the few toys that is actually holding up to the chewing power of three great danes! They are loving the double ended rings. The puppies each grab on to one and prance around the yard. Evening chewing session find it to be a very popular toy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So I have a 95 ibs Rottweiler and a 100 ibs pit and they love to play tug of war with it. We have had this for about 2 and a half years now and my two boys have only chewed little nibbles of it off. They are really strong. My two buddy’s literally have chewed up every thing else besides the go nuts donuts and their Kong toys. Overall this is very strong, durable, and long lasting. Also I would very much recommend this two for people who have multiple or just one big dog.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Okay I just wanted to write a review telling y’all how great this toy was but man I didn’t realize I had to use 50 characters to do so lol hope y’all have a good day!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My German shepherd is not interested in this toy but loves every other toy in the house, especially the squeaky balls by Chuckit! brand. This tug toy is super heavy but it seems that it would last awhile even for a heavy-duty chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is great for my 1 year old St. Bernard. Perfect size. Perfect for tug for both human and dog. A little heavy to throw, but bounces wildly and fun to chase. No way she can puncture this. It does smell very strong of rubber, but does eventually wear off some. It actually helps her find its hiding.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My two Bulldogs think this is an answer to their ""tug-of-war"" prayers. And it is. It is the only toy that has not cracked, or split, during the most raucous craziness they put it through. I had to take one star off for two issues - first is that it only comes in one size so it is a bit large for my female bulldog to get a grip on, and the second issue is that it only comes in the color black. The toy being a black heavy rubber makes it almost impossible to see on the dark (mahogany) wood floors that cover all but my bathrooms, and has resulted in me tripping over this toy so many times that I ended up breaking one of my toes on it a few weeks ago. If it were brightly colored, I'd be able to notice</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this over 2 years ago. It is starting to wear now and I will definitely order again because it has stood up to 2 Pitbulls and has just recently started to show wear and tear.

Thank you Goughnuts!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Me and my dogs enjoy these toys like no other.

So... I threw out the first one and replaced it with this one and, pithing 10 to 15 minutes, the same thing happened.   Very dissatisfied.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This chew is great! My pup has some tough chompers and lesser toys have bitten the dust rather quickly, but this bone was a long-loved favorite of hers. It lasted about 10 months before I had to take it away from her because she had chewed it down on one end and it got too rough for her mouth. It can get a little messy since it comes off in little scraps as they chew, but other than that this was fantastic.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My little power chewer LOVES this bone!  She wrestles with it, throws in down the stairs and then chases it, and eventually (months later) chews it down to a nub.  She is the epitome of a power chewer, and nothing stands up to her chewing like this large nylabone.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My experiences has been that different dogs like different toys and chews. This dog is an approx. one year old stray who, after being through the shelter and search for owner process, is here to stay. He seems to be easily trainable but still, guiltily, has made some teeth marks on a few things. He chewed through some hard rubber toys in a couple of days. He chews on this bone throughout the day, and nothing comes off! Happy dog.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My super chewer loves this bone toy.  Nylabones are about the only toy he can enjoy safely.  Chewy has great prices on these so I usually add one to my dog food order to get free shipping!!  Love Chewy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Very strong and she took right to it. Many chew toys have been destroyed in minutes. This one is sticking with her and she enjoys chewing on it, but hasn’t destroyed it. I would recommend it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was a pretty expensive bone and extremely heavy. My dog is 62 pounds and loves bones but does not really care for this one. Since the first day I gave her this bone she tried at times to chew on it then within seconds puts it down and walks away and does not bother at all with it. This isn't Chewys fault just the bone. I think it's just too hard and way too heavy. And way too much money for a bone!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I didn't expect my dog to love it so much. When I took it out of the package, I thought it was too hard for her, and I couldn't smell the chicken flavor. I just thought I wasted money again buying her chew toys she does not like. But Darla loves it so much, she carries it everywhere she goes and enjoys chewing it under my bed. It's really funny to hear her chewing sounds.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I wasn't too ecstatic about the cost but it's worth it. These bones are tough enough for extreme power chewers. They're quite heavy but nothing large breed dogs can't handle. I originally received one of these in a bundle pack but because I was so impressed, I purchased another separately. I can see these lasting a very long time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Let me tell you, my dog will destroy EVERYTHING. She finds a weak spot in everything I give her and WILL tear it up ASAP. I gave her this bone about 1 in the afternoon, its currently 9:30 PM. All toys would have been demolished and thrown away by now. This one is a fighter! Shes been chewing almost all day and only left chew marks on the ends. This is SUPER long lasting and so worth every penny! My smaller Shih Tzu had no interest in this bone or the smaller ones I gave her, so be careful if your dog is picky. My shih Tzu prefers the smelly bones and I buy her the healthy edibles ones because they smell.

I've tried nearly every kind of chew recommended to me. From nylabones to Himalayan cheese chews, he rejected it all. He rather chew on plastic (especially squeakers).

However now that he chewed down and the ridges are now flat, he doesn’t play or chew it anymore.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Now, first things first - these are not indestructible. They will wear and tear and, depending on your dog, if they figure out you tear up the inside edge to get the treat out, they’ll die in a few days. 

With the five dogs who’ve used these, that’s literally never happened to me. Long term damage, that built up from regular use over a few weeks, sure, but not within a day. That includes - a pitbull, a boxer mix, a boston terrier (surprisingly the hardest on the toys considering she has like eight teeth left), a very sharp toothed dachsund mix, and a chihuahua mix. 

Next, these are treats. For your really heavy, strong chewers, the treat isn’t going to last more than 30-40 minutes.

This was the first time we'd tried this one. He chewed it for a few minutes then suddenly let out a yelp. We checked him out and couldn't see what was wrong. He avoided the Nylabone for the rest of the day, though. The next day, he picked it up again and almost immediately dropped it and actually backed away from it as though it had hurt him. He then studiously avoided it for the rest of the day, giving it a wide berth, not wanting to go near it. We have no idea what happened, but it obviously hurt him.

A big part of why it's hard for a dog to chew through is the diameter of the toy.  Since it's so big around, the dog can't put quite as much pressure on it when he chews.  

I debated between the Maxx and the Maxx50, and ultimately decided on the Maxx.  I'm glad I did--it's a great size for my Rott.  And as heavy as it already is, I'd hate to see an even heavier version.  

I'm not sure I'd say this is his absolutely favorite toy, but he definitely enjoys it.  We have a lighter red bone toy that we use to play catch since this one is so heavy, but it's really great for him when</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is one of the few brands I trust to pay for toys because I know my dog can chew them to her hearts content and not break into the toy or break it apart.

I have a one year old lab mix who is an aggressive chewer. I thought she would love this because she can pounce on it and roll it around on her own and also chew without destroying. She seems to have no interest in it though. It does look durable though.  Hopefully I can find a way to interest her because I did find it somewhat expensive.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this and the donut style one too, and my power chewers won’t touch either one unless they’re covered in peanut butter. They seem tough and like they would stand up well, but they do have a rubber odor, and they are quite heavy. No fault to the toy itself, I’ve had a lot of recommendations for this brand of toy, so I figured we’d try it. If your dogs like chewing other rubber type toys they might like goughnuts too.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 2 Staffordshire Bull Terriers love playing with the GoughNuts ring toy, so I ordered the ""Stick"" and they love it just as much.  It's more of a challenge for them to use when playing tug-o-war but they play with it alot.  It really smells of rubber, but I'm not complaining.... this is well worth the money for our two big-mouthed babies and their strong jaws.  Highly recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was excited to purchase this for my power chewer.  Within the first day you could see little teeth marks.  His initial response was promising that he would enjoy the stick but that enjoyment has completely dropped off.  I wouldn’t purchase another one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pitbull is a power chewer and, if unsupervised, will continue to gnaw on his toys until they’re in pieces. I bought this toy because I really liked the safety feature that let owners know when to take the toy away, but didn’t expect it to last as long as it has! He loves chewing it, play tug, and fetch with this toy and there isn’t a scratch on it! We didn’t think it would last a day, let alone two weeks (and still intact!), because the rubber seemed soft and he could easily chew it to pieces just like others that came before him. Turns out, it’s just soft enough to be difficult to penetrate its outer barrier! Very happy with this purchase and worth the price tag.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I never write reviews! We got the Maxx version of this stick for my power chewer Northern breed mix, Rigby. He chews on this almost daily for thirty minutes or more. It is virtually unscathed other than some teeth marks. If you have a chewer who has destroyed other rubber toys, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this toy in the black, Maxx version specifically. I will say it is quite heavy so it might not be a big hit with a smaller dog (say less than 40ish pounds?).</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this on a whim because we canceled our BarkBox subscription a few months back and my dog misses getting new toys every month lol. She is a pitbull and will destroy toys in minutes, unless they're the thick rubber material. So I got this one, hoping it would be ok. She absolutely -LOVES- it. It's easy to pull out of her mouth when we play, because it's smooth, and it's dense but not HARD. It has a little flexibility to it. It's sturdy and she hasn't even made any marks on it, which is crazy. I'm really glad I got it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Fantastic!!!
