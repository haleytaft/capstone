We have a 3 month border collie mix puppy, and most of the reviews that this didn't work for have dogs that were bigger or better chewers, so I thought. I didn't think she would get through it as fast as she did. The pink one was chewed up in less than an hour. She really loved it, but we can't safely let her keep chomping it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I do not know how to rate this. The puppy this was purchased for is a 10 wk. old Irish Wolfhound.
She carries this toy around quite a bit; however, she does not chew on it.  I do not know if it is the texture or the hardness of it.  She chews her other toys that are smoother and less hard.  I believe that it is this puppy’s preference and nothing to do with the toy itself. That is why I gave it a three; I have no clue as to how it will hold up if she does ever actually chew it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was impressed with the toy at first, being it is made from a hard plastic.  However when I gave this to my pup, he had it chewed up in less than an hour!!  I do not recommend this toy for dogs who chew on everything or bigger breed pups.  I ordered this with 2 squeak toys which I refuse to give him those as I know he will destroy them in no time as well.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">this is the winner of our chewy haul. ordered a variety of chew toys to try out for our new puppy and so far this is her favorite. she's only 9 weeks old, and like chewing on our fingers (ouch!) this toy is just slightly softer than a normal chew toy and she loves it. having a couple toys and ring seems to entertain her more than a typical bone. will it last forever? probably not. but nice to not have puppy shark teeth attacking my fingers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 3 month old GoldenDoodle he loved this in the first few days I gave it to him and the other weeks had past and he still plays with it and it’s definitely in his top 5 he plays with most but when I was washing his toys for its weekly wash I have been noticing teeth marks on the ring and some on the toys but I didn’t think much about since there was nothing that bad on it that would choke or do something bad to him. but right now he is playing with it and it’s in pretty good shape just hopefully nothing bad happens!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is well made, but our puppy is totally disinterested in it.  I thought it would be a great chewy toy, but even when I give it to him and try to pull and entice him to play with it, he doesn't care.  He goes off to find something else.  This could just be my dog, I have no idea how other pups would react.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Good quality.  Bought this for the pup as she is starting to teeth.  The toy is a little bigger than I expected but that is ok.  I appreciate that there is two chewys on the ring.  I put them in the freezer for awhile and then give them to the pooch.  The bumpies on the chewys in addition to the cold from the freezer helps keep her interested.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a great chew toy for our puppies! We had gone to purchase puppy chew toys at stores because we needed something right away, and the stores only had plushies and kongs! We don't use plushies because the puppies chew them and eat the bits, and the kongs were just too big. These are perfect for our 8 week old puppies to teath on and they love them!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is one of the first chew toys I bought my pup when we got him. I thought it was cute. He loved it. So did my older pups. (the other two are 5). It's been chewed until it's just nubs and a ring. So I buy another.  I'm not sure how many I've purchased but I keep buying them when they start to break because my pup (who is now a 14 month old 50 lb chinese shar pei) loves this and who am I to say no? so, yes, I know it's for teethers, but my lil' guy said he's still teething and to give him his binky back.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These keys are just right for puppies with biting/teething issues.

Also, if you're on a budget, you can simply buy some peanut butter and spread it around the inside with a kitchen knife. Saves your house from teething destruction and they are also the best tool I have found for separation anxiety. Even my adult dogs get one right before I leave the house, and they don't even care that I'm leaving.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Just got this today and I know it's goofy to write a review right away about an item/purchase BUT(!) I tested it out as soon as I got home with my dog - he's usually iffy about toys or anything that is NOT food... I filled it with the cheese &amp; Bacon spray and he just went to town! Absolutely loves it. I've been thinking about getting one of these for a while but finally gave in and happy I did!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the perfect size for a puppy.  Only complaint was I ordered pink and received blue.  Puppy didn't mind but the owner gave me a hard time (jokingly).  Puppy loved it and it does keep her entertained when owner needs quiet time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Smaller than I expected and I ordered a size bigger than what I was expecting. Other than that it’s good, my dog likes it as a treat.
I put kibble in it, wet it, then freeze it but you don’t need to freeze it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Even as a puppy, my dog was quite a chewer. And, as most puppies do, she had absolute razor-blade teeth. She would poke holes in this and rip pieces of rubber off of it. Before it was damaged, it was really useful to cram full of peanut butter and freeze for her to get out when she was having separation anxiety.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It doesn't save the fingers and hands from sharp tiny milk teeth but, Yellow Dog loves to toss it around and make it bounce and chase after it and chew on it, lol! So energy outlet wise it is a great toy from puppies!!! :D</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Finally, a really tiny chew toy for my Pug puppy.  She will actually be able to grab it and it is indeed softer than the standard Kong,  I ordered the small as well because she may grow out of this tiny XSmall one quickly but it is the perfect starter!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is his favorite Kong. We ordered it in blue (for a boy) . Although, when I called customer service to request the blue one, they told me they can not guarantee the color that will come. It DID arrive in blue!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Chihuahua/Pug mixed babies are massive chewers. Most of the items I give to them are destroyed in a few hours (or less). They love the challenge of getting their treats, and they are easily cleaned and sanitized. Hooray for me AND my babies!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This puppy kong is easy for my 12 lb girl to carry around and chew. I wish it was a bit shorter because she can't get the squeeze cheese or peanut butter and the end of the treat. It's really difficult to clean, but I will keep using it because it holds treats well and she loves it!</span>]",moderate,chew toys,https://www.chewy.com/kong-puppy-dog-toy-color-varies-small/dp/38488

My hound likes to chew on my wood coffee table and wood toybox when I go to work. They like this toy, but it's not their favorite. It's heavy to throw, but would be okay outside.  It's very well made and good quality, so I upped my review from 3-stars to 4 because it's not the company's fault my dogs are picky about the wood they chew. From my dogs' behaviors, I'd bet that this toy tastes like wood. (I did not taste this toy.) I'm satisfied with the purchase, not sure if it's for everyone. Sometimes the dogs will gnaw on it while they're chilling on the couch, but not for long. I have a medium dog </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a durable toy they keeps it’s shape even when the dogs are trying to destroy it. I have not had any sharp edges yet but we do get some peace’s broken off as they chew so we watch for that.

The love the way it feels and gives them a good gripping surface. If you have a medium (50lb) dog I would not go smaller then the  medium and would recommend leaning towards the next size up.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The two dogs that visit my house regularly love these sticks. The only complaint I have is that it leaves hard little bits that I have to clean up after every chew session. i will add that I have to clean up after every rope toy or other material is played with as well. They are super aggressive chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dogs both chew on sticks like it's going out of style, but we didn't want to encourage that, especially in the house. We got them each one of the dogwood tough toys and they LOVE them!! They typically choose these over a normal Nylabone. If you have a chewer I would highly recommend this product!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this for my highly destructive German Shepherd Dog who can destroy toys in seconds. We’ve had this for two weeks and it’s still holding strong. I will say that she doesn’t find the toy to be that fun, though. It’s very hard and doesn’t seem to give her a lot of satisfaction.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog usually loves these kinds of hard chew toys but for some reason wasn’t a big fan of this one. He did chew it up but it wasn’t nearly as interesting to him as other chew toys before. The quality of the bone is otherwise excellent and a good durable choice for big chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Got this when my dog was smaller and it stopped him from bringing sticks inside. He’s had the same one for over a year until I just threw it away. 10/10 recommend, I’ll be purchasing another one really soon. It’s his favorite toy to chew on that he actually doesn’t destroy!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I first tried these on the recommendation of an employee of a pet store. My lab/terrier mix would actually  chew through small sapplings in my yard in order to get sticks for his chewing obsession.  He loves these. They only last about a month before they get so small that I have to toss them, but most toys only last a day on my house.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 6 month old goldendoodle likes to chew, but she’s never ruined even stuffed animals. And yet... she’s been chewing on the dogwood for less than 10 minutes and it’s already starting to flake. I’m worried about her eating too much of it so I’ll have to take it away soon, which is a bummer because a. It’s more expensive than a beef tendon and lasts even less time, b. she really likes it, and c. I literally gave it to her 8 minutes ago. Thought this could help cut on some tendon/bully stick expenses and calories. What a shame. Also, it’s almost too heavy for her to carry.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So I have a retriever puppy, Max, who is 9 months old now. He'd always bring in sticks from the backyard that had fallen from the tress (sometimes big ones, don't ask me how he got them through both dog doors...). But now he plays with these instead of bringing in sticks from outside and shredding the pieces around the house. Even our other dog Iris, who is extremely picky about toys and will only play with Antlers with marrow, plays with these and gnaws on them happily. Even better there's no mess to clean up, no splinters or broken off pieces, the toy wears evenly/smoothly as both my pups gnaw away at them.</span>]",moderate,chew toys,https://www.chewy.com/petstages-dogwood-tough-dog-chew-toy/dp/46955

She’s 10 months old and still likes to chew. I bought the peanut butter filler to go with it. I originally loved it at first because she was distracted for a good two hours while I worked (I froze the toy with the peanut butter filler inside).

I bought 3 more (black extreme version this time) to ensure I always have some in the freezer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 3 month puppy absolutely loves this toy, as do my partner and I. We like to fill this with his wet dog food, freeze it and then let him play with it when we need to keep him busy. This toy allows us both to work from home--taking Zoom meetings undistracted! This toy is very durable and strong, exactly what a teething puppy needs. I can't recommend this toy enough.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">All of my dogs love/loved this toy. They get excited each and every single time with give it to them daily.  It allows them some challenges to get to their treat which gives them some positive stimulation.  They hold up for a long time as well.  Just make sure you choose the Kong best for your dogs age and size.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I filled it with treats and she was busy for a while then she gets really tired with all the licking. I got the medium one and to me it is soo tiny. My puppy is medium sized and is about 35 pounds. I expected it to be a lot larger but the measurements are correct so I would recommend going a size up for more fun. I used a tennis ball to compare the size of the medium kong</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We put peanut butter and a few pieces of kibble/treats into the Kong and freeze it overnight. It keeps our pittie busy for a long time which is great for him and great for us!

They can be filled with wet puppy food and frozen. Some can be filled with broken cookie pieces awaiting use during a Zoom meeting or used to get us to a meal. And there are a couple freshly emptied. She loves them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My two foster puppies, Cosmo and Cleo, absolutely LOVED these toys and were deliriously happy when I filled them with the peanut butter filling. They were kept happy and amused for hours and the Kong was the best teething toy ever!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I haven't given this to my dog as yet.

If other food toys are out smarted or destroyed by your dog- BUY THIS ONE!

My Aussie/heeler outsmarts or destroys most of the “interactive toys” much to my wallet’s dismay. The last food ball I bought she would roll around her bolster bed instead of the floor. With her other food toys she’ll hold them and unscrew them. 

This toy has officially outworked her. SCORE!

The toy is bottom heavy making it easy to fill and making the dog actually work for the food. They have to bobble or push it to get any food. It is made of a plastic that is hard and durable but not brittle. 

This toy is not obnoxiously loud on hard floors like many others. (If your dog can throw it</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I wanted to give it 5 stars. It is a great products and perfect for a busy dog. We got the large one for our sheepadoodle puppy and it took him a little while to figure it out. Although when he did it only took him a few minutes to clear it out. We feed him lunch in it most days to get some of his energy out and he loves it. If you have a smart dog as soon as they learn how it works it won’t take much. I’d give it 5 stars if it took him longer to clean out, maybe when we switch to adult dog food where the pieces are a little bigger.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 50lb Catahoula girl absolutely loves it! She is crazy about food, and can eat all of her food from a slow feeder bowl in under two minutes. With this, it takes her about 15 minutes to completely empty it. She has more difficult food/treat dispensing toys but that take her longer, but I like that I can fit her whole meal in this and not have to refill it. Heavy chewers should not be left alone with it though. she doesn't chew on it other than to pick it up and move it, and after a week the top is pretty cut up. It'd be easy for her to take a chunk out of the plastic if she wanted to.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Keeps my crazy lab busy during breakfast and dinner. I usually split his kibble portion in half in his slow feeder and feed him in his wobbler kong outside to keep him busy. The kong is huge so if you have a big dog, get the large. My lab thought this was a toy and started to chew on the top, but eventually figured out that it dispenses treats/kibble. It's entertaining watching him use his nose and paws to get the treats out of the toy. Definitely would recommend this to prolong feeding times and also keep you pup mentally and physically stimulated.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my third slow feeder, and I actually love this one (and so does my pup). All the martial is a hard plastic and the bottom screws off for easy, thorough cleaning. The opening in the side is large enough for the large pieces of kibble to easily fall out without getting jammed, but still requiresb our pup to put in some effort to get his food.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our big boy figured this toy out quickly and can’t get enough of it! It’s larger than I expected but I don’t mind and neither does he. We get a larger kibble so usually only 3-4 pieces max fall out at once, which slows mealtime down nicely. He doesn’t give up till he’s got every bit out. It’s a pretty firm plastic, unlike most kong chew toy types, but there’s no edge for him to really try and chew except for the hole for the treats. He hasn’t been able to break it and he’s a power chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This unscrews to place the treats inside. We had one years ago and our dogs ignored it. Not so with our newest Dane/Mastiff. Not only is she occupied for long periods with this, but she manages to get it unscrewed no matter how tight we screw it together. A true joy to watch her struggles.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This Kong is awesome! When you need some time to decompress after a long day,  this toy will keep you baby busy! We all love our furbabbies but there are times you just need a few minutes to yourself. I love all the kisses I get from my boy. When he sees me putting kibble in this Kong, he gets so excited! Believe me, you and your baby will love it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My coonhound is really enjoying this toy. I use it to feed most of his meals and find it to be more effective than a slow feed bowl.

He brings it to me to put treats in it so I have to hide it sometimes. It is still in great shape. pretty much like the day I bought it and yes he does chew on it. I take a round treat about the size of the hole, put Kong squeeze cheese on the end of it, then put in one end to block it, cheese on inside of course. Leave a little sticking out.

I had to pick a few larger chips of the bone off the rug before they were ingested. The brown bone (peanut butter) was with my strong chewer.

Then, I tried thinner bully sticks and they also fell through. Greenie type chews are also too thick. Sigh... I am not giving up though. I just need to find the right sized product for the middle. The dogs enjoyed them but obviously they can’t get out the hammered in bully sticks so they presently aren’t suiting our need but will keep looking for a perfect product for the middle. Too expensive to give up on these but honestly  if they were cheaper I probably would call it a loss and donate them. Therefore, I am on the fence as to </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These, along with the Kong, are my dogs' favorite interactive toys. I insert either a fish skin (The Honest Kitchen wolfish skins) or Triumph salmon and sweet potato jerky treats in the large size toy. The fish skins work in both the medium and large toy, depending on the width of the treat. It seems like these toys are indestructible.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This keeps my dog occupied longer than a frozen Kong. I put a medium sized whimzee about half way in it and then add some nutro crunchy treats and mini milkbones. I seal the end and side holes with PB. My dog figured out quick that as soon as she got the PB off the bigger hole of a kong that she could just pick it up and drop it and the treats would fall out. We give her one of these in the morning when we go to work and she usually has the whimzee finished but has not gotten all the small treats out inside. Really good puzzle toy. They’re also dishwasher safe so they’re super easy to clean! We love them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 70lb pit bull who is now 10 years old and has always been a super powerful chewer. I have had many toys for him over the years and had my doubts at first but this has become my go to toy for him and I have recommended it so many times now to other people. It is the longest lasting toy he has ever had. It does get full of teeth marks after a while and sometimes small pieces may come off but he doesn’t bother with them and they are small. Overall it stays in tact and lasts a very long time. I always make sure I have a spare to switch out when it gets rough looking. He loves this toy. It is worth a try if you are looking to entertain your powerful chewer!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We LOVE west paw! Everything lasts forever but this product which should be one of the more tough toys. We put bully sticks and Real Dog Box chews in here so my pit mix really works to get them out. I have to buy a new one every 3/4 months but I will do it forever. Big fan of this thing!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Great product, we tear up one jerky treat and slide it in the grooves and this makes a regular treat last 30 minutes or longer versus if he had it alone. He mostly disregards it when there's no food in it but that's not when we use it. Comparable to a kong, but the dog has to work harder for this.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My bully mix loved this toy - absolutely obsessed with it. It lasted about three days before he started pulling chunks off of it. 
It is a great toy for treats but I wouldn't recommend it for tough chewers, especially unsupervised.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We buy West Paw because they are the only toy to withstand our chewers in fostering.

I bought a few treat dispensing toys to hopefully engage them all. My aussie is so obsessed with this toy when I put a treat inside, she will play nonstop. She doesn't even put it down to bark. lol.. She will literally bark with the toy in her mouth and carry it out with her to potty.

I suggest freezing once PB is spread on otherwise while PB lasts longer, it is not a lot longer.  The product otherwise is similar to Nylabones which mine aren't a fan of.

This is about the first toy that our smaller dog (45#) hasn’t been able to “eat”.  Terrier-Cattle dog mix and can chew through everything - until now!

Yes pricy but worth it!  Since this one has done so well we plan on getting the larger GoughNuts..  It’s also great for two dogs - awesome tug toy, the other dog is 100 pounds and between the two of them this GoughNuts has held up remarkably.

Hopefully he plays with it one day so its ot a waste!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">When I adopted my pit (5 y/o), I had an old, chewed-up peanut butter flavored Nylabone in which he would grab to chew on his own. I wanted more knobs/ends for him to chew so I bought this bacon flavored Benebone. He has not touched this at all for a month. I was surprised since he is not picky with food. I've slathered peanut butter on this and he doesn't lick it. I've tried using a knife to make little cuts so the aroma may release. I've even left the chew toy with his kibble in the storage container. It's a shame he doesn't like it.

He's enjoying it and there's no risk of death by foreign body obstruction, so we're both happy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a super-chewer, and I can only buy the most durable Nylabones.

It took her about six to eight months, but she finally has it down just to the little V connecting part, and she still LOVES it. It is SO worth the price!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have been buying more benebones than any other brand just because I would prefer my pup's chew toys to be made in the US.

It provides some much needed mental stimulation for my 6 month Dalmatian puppy and she LOVES it! She will carry it from room to room with her to chew on. She loves the everlasting treat inserts but they only last maybe two days with an hour or two of chewing per day. Also by the end she can usually get out a big hunk of treat at a time and I worry that she doesn’t chew it enough so I hope it’s easily digestible! The bonus is that you can shove additional treats in the bottom. I like to put frozen carrots or blueberries in the bottom so she really has to work to get them out. Keeps her entertained even longer than the insert treats! So overall a really good treat ball,</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have 3 big dogs and bought these hoping the would chew them...that they did and got them out of the holder within a couple minutes! Was hoping they would do the normal and chew; one did but she even busted the rubber and got the middle ""everlasting chew"" out and then chowed down on it. They love it so i gave 2 stars but definitely not worth the $ if you're dog is a motivated dog or a huge chewer when it comes to something like a treat. This is maybe an hour after we got it...the rubber outside didn't hold up either! They got them discs out of the rubber and gone!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I gave this to my 45 lb puppy with some kibble in the treat side and the treat that came with the bento ball in place. She LOVES it! She's been working on it for a little over an hour - and the treat is about half done, but she already tore one side of the ball out so she could just gnaw on the treat.

Disappointing, since she doesn't like chewing hard toys, so I thought this could work for more than one use.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loved this toy, and the treat was a good dental chew. However, on the third or fourth day of giving it to him, I looked over and saw he had eaten a large chunk of the rubber (see photo below). He's a strong chewer for sure, but he is under 35 pounds, so this toy should not be advertised as virtually indestructible or for strong chewers. If you've got a dog that isn't quite as strong, though, this toy would be excellent for them for hours of entertainment.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was worried that my 100+ lb shredder pupper would destroy the rubber as others reviewed. However, after seeing one of these bad boys at my friends place (with 7 crazy dogs), I decided to invest in one.  No damage has been done! My other concern was if my dog would even like the treat that it came with (he is spoiled and picky with new things). At first I paired the everlasting treat with some of his Rachael Ray’s Soup bones (stored it in the other side). He didn’t seem to like it at first. Then I decided to rinse off any possible residue on the top of it first. Now I have to monitor how long he has a treat for. He will go at it until he’s out of breath and tired. This treat could’ve probably</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">At first I was kinda worried seeing as other dogs have taken chunks from this toy. My Oakley is a very big chewer and I wanted something to deter him from chewing my clothes, or jumping up against the counter, and trying to take stuff that isn’t his. As soon as I pulled this out of the packaging I haven’t seen him go for anything he’s not supposed to. Will be getting some replacement treats for this toy because he’s loving it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I purchased my first Bento Ball from my local pet boarding/daycare facility. Was told is would last for a long time to help with boredom. Mi Mini Goldendoodle had it eaten within about a hour. 
I thought I’d get a different one and maybe it would last. And it lasted about 2 hours. 
Of course that is longer but was not as long as described. No way it would last 6-8 hours. The holder would be destroyed by then. I will continue to use them but wish it was a little more sturdy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Bloodhound Ellie loves this toy! Whenever I put in a new treat it's her go to toy keeps her occupied for about 15 to 20 minutes (which is really good for her). I have filled with the Starmark Everlasting Chicken with the rounded top, but I've used the other chicken flavored and the ridged one as well. She loved them too I just order the liver one to see if she likes it as well.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this because my dog loves to chew. It is advertised to be indestructible but my dog determined that false. This was after only having it about 30 minutes. The rubber casing around the bone part is actually pretty soft compared to normal chewers. One the rubber part is messed up the bone part becomes pointless. I don’t think it’s a terrible toy but I do think it is marketed falsely, not everlasting, and didn’t last “hours”, “virtually indestructible” false!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We adopted a 9 year old beagle pup in January, and quickly learned that he didn't really know how to play. He doesn't understand fetch, and doesn't really like to chew anything that's not food. However, I wanted to find something to keep him busy when we aren't outside enjoying a walk. This toy fit's the bill! Our pup isn't really interested in licking the large treat, but he loves pushing the ball around with his nose trying to get smaller treats out. He's gotten so good at it that it only takes him a few minutes to get every last bite out! I wished it lasted a bit longer, but I'm just happy he's excited about a toy!</span>]",extreme,chew toys,https://www.chewy.com/starmark-everlasting-treat-bento-ball/dp/45443

I specifically looked for a extreme chew type of toy that my 9 month old golden doodle would be able to use a few times at the minimum. However, after less than 15 minutes, it was already destroyed.

This item is safe. They enjoy the  bison flavor. It doesn't get those sharp points that some chew toys get after use. It lasts awhile so it is a bargain.

Great product!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">For a dog that has usually not been interested in Nylabone, it says a lot that he hasn’t really rejected this. I got the Nylabone durachew shishkabob and funnel cake twin pack in this order, too, and he prefers those, but dogs have individual preferences!  He likes rubbery-feeling toys, but as he literally eats them, I stay away from them. This bone has embossed printing on it so I rub natural peanut butter in the letters to interest him. I’m fairly confident he will eventually chew this like he does his newly discovered enjoyment of the other Nylabone ‘bones’. I feel safe in putting this in his crate with him at night and when I’m gone from home. He’s a 60-ish pound extremely high energy Labrador</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves this and it's holding strong. I would recommend this product and would purchase it again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered this for my best friend’s dog who shreds any toy he has. He loves the flavor and we’re happy he finally had a toy that’ll last.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog was completely uninterested in this toy, which surprised me. But I gave it to my roommate's dog who chewed her heart out! To this day (months later), there are only small teeth marks in it, and she's a medium-sized Australian Shepherd.

The peanut smells great, and my dog loved it. After a week or so it got really sharp and my dog insisted on chewing only the single side. I would remove the sharp parts but he was quickly cutting his mouth. This toy is just so weird because your dog needs to be the exact right type of chewer, not too calm, not too aggressive. Before you give this to your dog check the Benebone website. They recommend throwing this chew toy away after only moderate use and replacing it monthly.

He had a chicken flavored chew toy that is ready to be retired. I saw that this came in his favorite flavor, peanut butter, and knew I had to get it for him. When I first gave it to him, he didn’t give it so much as a second glance. Which is unusual for him as he loves his flavored chew toys. It took me spreading a bit of real peanut butter on this for him to even acknowledge it. Now he loves it. It seems like it’s tough enough to last him a while, and I can’t see any way of it hurting him.

But, I bought Benebone wishbones and Benebone sticks and these things are REALLY used, loved by all three, and have been the best money ever spent on a thing to chew on.  They really hold up a very long time. In fact, I don't know if they will ever destruct. They get used every single day, but they are still going strong. Plus, they are cruelty free, which is an essential quality. Yay Benebone! For what it's worth, the wishbone is loved more than the sticks, but I think it is really</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We received over Chewy box in last night, couldn’t wait to give the puppy her new chew bone in the morning. She must’ve loved it because she already scrapped it up within the first 45 mins of use ! I was hoping it would’ve lasted a little longer for the price :( I don’t know if it’s just her puppy teeth or she has half pitty in her :) but the dog seemed to really enjoy.

Overall I rated this particular chew bone a 4 as my puppy loved it but should’ve probably been given a 3 due to the short life span of 45 mins (if that) and almost $12.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I've gotten these for my dogs in the past and they LOVED them. I tried the peanut butter flavor for my new pup and she has zero interest. Funny thing is, I've tried to give it away to a few friends' dogs and they have zero interest too, even those who love peanut butter. We've since purchased the other flavors and they are a huge hit. The peanut butter is just NOT appealing to them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Benebone dog chews are the best! They come in many flavors and keeps dogs busy for hours.

Best bones ever!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">In the past we have only used nylabones. Our younger lab will chew them, but not as enthusiastically as our older ones.

My test for a successful toy is: 

1. Does she immediately enjoy it?

And they are at them every day. They don't have a disagreeable smell and I wash them periodically to get off old dog saliva. We have even lopped off the really gnarly ends when they get too rough to give the bones more life. It you do this just make sure that what is remaining is too large for your pet to swallow</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">One of my dogs thoroughly enjoys the hard plastic toys you often see in the regular toy shipping services. I purchased one of these tough dog chew toys some time back and she had chewed up the ends pretty well so I felt it was time for a new one. When it arrived from Chewy in the mail, she immediately came running over to receive it, happily trotted off, and plopped down to start gnawing away at it. It's definitely a great toy for heavy chewers that need something super durable.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We got this about a week and a half ago for our beagle who loves to chew. It's her new favorite toy. The small is a great size for her and the shape makes it easy for her to hold it the way she likes. She already gnawed one of the points down about halfway and there are some gouges over the rest of it, but for her that's good durability and shows it's not too hard for her teeth.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Scottish terriers are OBSESSED with benebone brand toys. I don’t know what it is! They chew on them for hours. Eventually after a number of months they manage to wear them down, but it’s really incredible! I got this one because my boy likes sticks so thought he might like one he’d actually be allowed to chew. He loves it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Chewy's delivery time was impeccable, as usual; the product?  A waste of money.  Addie Lynn (27 lb. miniature schnauzer) wouldn't touch it.  I tried ""scooting"" it across floor, then wetting it to allow some more scent, nothing worked.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have another benebone that didn’t work for our dog - he chewed it up quick and then it was so sharp it was cutting his gums. This one is completely different somehow and stays soft for many hours of chewing. We will definitely be buying this again and again!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves this bone. We discovered this bone from a friend who had brought one  for her dog to a birthday party for her niece that we were at.  My dog took the bone and enjoyed chewing it. Came home and ordered it from Chewy. That is where our friend had gotten it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It’s about the only chew toy we’ve found that lasts any length of time. I have a Cavie who chews like a dog three times his size but these last a good month or more and he loves them!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have bought these before in smaller size when or dogs were smaller, and they really enjoyed them. They lasted for months. Was glad to find them in the bigger size as our dogs are almost grown.  They really like to chew on them. They swap out every now and then as if its something different than the other one has. We usually get a peanut butter flavor kind but they seem to like the maple flavor better. We will buy again!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our new rescue dog has chewed everything and rips ropes apart.

Unfortunately, once our Golden couldn't figure out how to get more treat out, he started ripping on the tire ridges. I was unsurprised, since, when I opened the package, I thought the tire felt soft, but I did find it surprising considering the marketing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I liked the idea of this toy but my dog didn’t like it. After a a couple days she did eat the treat that came with it. No obvious chewing of the rubber toy though. I replaced the treat and she never touched the toy again. The treat did have a very weird sweet smell to it. I had left the treat in the garage and whenever I went in there I could smell it. My dog literally tries to eat garbage and isn’t picky at all. Maybe some different flavors would be better?</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Not sure why there are so many negative reviews regarding the smell. Not sure if they are talking about the rubber or the treat. I washed the rubber just because thats what I do with new stuff. The rubber nor the treat have an odor. Sometimes my dog is able to work the puck out of the tire but when he doesn't it keeps him busy for hours. I have a size medium for my miniature poodle and a large for my lab mix. This chew works well for us.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Good news:  my dog loved it. Bad news:  he had the treat out of the tire in under 15 minutes and devoured it in another 15 minutes
He is an 18 lb dog, and I got the medium (15-40 lbs). So at 150 calories that’s quite a hefty snack.  I thought this would be something he would gnaw on and put aside for later, but nope. The treat part is kind of soft/chewy, not hard. I don’t consider my dog an aggressive chewer but he is highly food motivated. I’ll try the tire with some peanut butter in the grooves, it seems pretty substantial.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Try as I do to find a toy that can live up to its claims, I can’t. The only toy that has lasted so far is the black, extra tough Kongs. My guy had the entire top of the treat gone within 20 minutes. It took him another 40 to begin biting off pieces. He gets so excited to have new toys and though we have to take them away. So that was $$$ wasted! Very disappointed!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">our dogs love this toy/snack. This snack will keep the Dog busy licking and playing with the indestructible rubber tire. It is refillable so it has a long life. Our dogs eat everything. This is still around and still fun for them. Money well spent on dog toys. Our puppy carries it around the house and our older dog follows her.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this to replace one I have had for a while. Out of the package it had an overly sweet fake vanilla scent. My dog ate up the treat and enjoyed removing it, however, it made him sick to his stomach. He used to bring me the old one all the time hoping for a treat but he hasn’t touched this one since the first night. The treats have never caused a problem before so I am guessing it was whatever was put on the wheel itself to give that smell. I am disappointed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a great idea for a toy but it didn't work out for us. First of all, it smells really bad and the odor is so strong, it has to stay outside. Like fake vanilla. Some folks might like that but I don't. It's so strong it clings to rugs and surfaces. Yuck. One of my two dogs was interested in it as an outside toy for a while but once the ridges got flattened from licking and chewing, she lost interest. Now it's just a stinky neglected piece of rubber hanging around stinking up my yard. Yup, after being outside for several weeks it just keeps on reeking. Next stop, the trash.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this for my bernedoodle. He had it started in pieces within a day. It's now a million tiny pieces. I am only getting toys that say they are ""tough"" but so far, have been sorely disappointed! He's definitely a tough chewer and this did not stand up to his chewing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Just another toy added to the long list of hundreds of dollars spent on toys. Another toy marketed for extreme chewers that lasted my dog all of 30 minutes before the actual rubber itself was shredded. The treat center held up 15.

I got this bone when I had my second foster, two years ago, and through the four super-chewer dogs that have played with this toy, they have hardly made a dent on this! They have all loved it, and it DEFINITELY smells like cheese, but it really is a hardy bone!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Vizsla is a heavy chewer and usually she will destroy toys in a matter of minutes. She has not destroyed this toy yet and she really likes it alot. I can see this one lasting a long time. Definitely worth the money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My little Yorkie mix super chewer is obsessed with these so we have several. Not any bone will do. These cheese bones and the Himalayan cheese chews are it. We get both from Chewy to keep up her habit.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Out of all the hard chew toys she has, this is my dogs favorite! This is actually her second one because she loved the first so much! Its nice that its different from all the meat flavored ones.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our hsuky loves yo chew and she will carry this around from room to room and leave it but has not chewed it yet. Since she loves cheese I thought she'd like it... kind of disappointed that it isn't cheesy enough for her to even nibble at it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My grand-dog loves the bone. She chews on it and carries it all over the house. She has rawhide treats all over the house but rarely goes back to them as she does with this bone.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves nylabones with texture so one with holes like cheese is perfect for her. She also loves the size because she can easily hold it between her paws. The flavor must be appealing to her as well because it's among her favorites.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Finally! My dog had a particular Nylabone that she always liked. She went through several of this exact particular bone, and then they stopped making her special favorite bone. Since then I’ve bought 6 different Nylabones for her and she turned her nose up at all of them. There was nothing left of her old one but a small stump and I really needed to confiscate it, so I was so happy when this one arrived today and she actually likes it! Not sure why this one is so much better? I think it’s probably the size and shape for her but she is extremely picky. Her old favorite one was also yellow. This one better stay in production for awhile!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is so spoiled. He's got lots of toys to choose from; this one isn't his favorite, but he still enjoys it. We've had this for a few months and is still holding up pretty good. If you're looking to give your dog a variety of chews get this one. Why not, spoil you dog like I do. :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs LOVE cheese, so I thought they would love this chew. They were interested at first, however now they will only chew on it if I put a little peanut butter in a few of the dimples.</span>]",extreme,chew toys,https://www.chewy.com/nylabone-durachew-cheese-flavored-dog/dp/149079

My dog has had nylabones before and they generally last 2 to 3 months before I need to replace them.   I gave him the larger one first, and within 15 minutes, pieces of it were all over my carpet.  So... I threw out the first one and replaced it with this one and, pithing 10 to 15 minutes, the same thing happened.   Very dissatisfied.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This chew is great! My pup has some tough chompers and lesser toys have bitten the dust rather quickly, but this bone was a long-loved favorite of hers. It lasted about 10 months before I had to take it away from her because she had chewed it down on one end and it got too rough for her mouth. It can get a little messy since it comes off in little scraps as they chew, but other than that this was fantastic.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My little power chewer LOVES this bone!  She wrestles with it, throws in down the stairs and then chases it, and eventually (months later) chews it down to a nub.  She is the epitome of a power chewer, and nothing stands up to her chewing like this large nylabone.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My experiences has been that different dogs like different toys and chews. This dog is an approx. one year old stray who, after being through the shelter and search for owner process, is here to stay. He seems to be easily trainable but still, guiltily, has made some teeth marks on a few things. He chewed through some hard rubber toys in a couple of days. He chews on this bone throughout the day, and nothing comes off! Happy dog.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My super chewer loves this bone toy.  Nylabones are about the only toy he can enjoy safely.  Chewy has great prices on these so I usually add one to my dog food order to get free shipping!!  Love Chewy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Very strong and she took right to it. Many chew toys have been destroyed in minutes. This one is sticking with her and she enjoys chewing on it, but hasn’t destroyed it. I would recommend it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was a pretty expensive bone and extremely heavy. My dog is 62 pounds and loves bones but does not really care for this one. Since the first day I gave her this bone she tried at times to chew on it then within seconds puts it down and walks away and does not bother at all with it. This isn't Chewys fault just the bone. I think it's just too hard and way too heavy. And way too much money for a bone!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I didn't expect my dog to love it so much. When I took it out of the package, I thought it was too hard for her, and I couldn't smell the chicken flavor. I just thought I wasted money again buying her chew toys she does not like. But Darla loves it so much, she carries it everywhere she goes and enjoys chewing it under my bed. It's really funny to hear her chewing sounds.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I wasn't too ecstatic about the cost but it's worth it. These bones are tough enough for extreme power chewers. They're quite heavy but nothing large breed dogs can't handle. I originally received one of these in a bundle pack but because I was so impressed, I purchased another separately. I can see these lasting a very long time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Let me tell you, my dog will destroy EVERYTHING. She finds a weak spot in everything I give her and WILL tear it up ASAP. I gave her this bone about 1 in the afternoon, its currently 9:30 PM. All toys would have been demolished and thrown away by now. This one is a fighter! Shes been chewing almost all day and only left chew marks on the ends. This is SUPER long lasting and so worth every penny! My smaller Shih Tzu had no interest in this bone or the smaller ones I gave her, so be careful if your dog is picky. My shih Tzu prefers the smelly bones and I buy her the healthy edibles ones because they smell. This bone has no smell and leaves no residue.</span>]",extreme,chew toys,https://www.chewy.com/nylabone-durachew-big-chew-chicken/dp/43354

Even when we insert it as the instructions say. Then he just gets a treat. An expensive treat to last just one night.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I thought this was the perfect chew for my little Aussie. The first two times he had it he gently licked away and the treat lasted the entire day and into the next. Unheard of with this pup. Unfortunately, since the first two uses, the treats now easily come out. He gulps them down and they do not last for any length of time. There are no tears holes or punctures in the rubber. Its hard for ME to get the treat in the toy but now easy for him to get it out? Really disappointed as I thought this was the perfect toy.

She had one from years ago and loved it. They must've gone to another manufacturer. I can't believe a company would put our pets health at risk...Chewy and Starmark!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This treat was not ever lasting in the slightest it took Koda my German Shepard 19 minutes to eat it right up , literally I timed it , and this it isn’t ever lasting there are refills for it and my girl loves it and that’s the whole point isn’t it , it keeps her occupied and happy while I do homework, so is it ever lasting no, is it worth it absolutely.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought two of these treat toys for my two dogs.  One is a power chewer.  I find the toy part is very tough and holds up well to a power chewer.  The down side is the treat ball that comes with the toy.  It just gets sticky and gross as the dogs lick at it.  At one point, my power chewer was able to pop it out and started to eat it outright.  I caught it and was able to take it away.  She popped it out multiple times, finally I flipped it around and inserted it backwards . That made it harder for her to remove.  Definitely supervise your dogs at all times with this toy.  I had purchased a pack of treat refills, but  I don’t think i will use any time soon.  The actual toy is good quality, so </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">While the treat inside the toy may not have been everlasting, the toy itself has zero damage against our 1.5 yr old Aussie Shepard mix. She’s a big chewer and usually takes minutes to devour her chew treats/give damage to toys but this one frustrates her and makes her work for it which is great. The disc treats seem a little easier for her to get out, still frustrating and take time, but overall less time than the ball treats that the toy comes with that they also sell. For our pup it was easily a 30 min-hour ordeal depending on the treat. And the toy as I said has zero damage so far with multiple plays. Even after we ran out of treats she’s still chewing on it and enjoying playing with just </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was so excited to get this ""everlasting treat"", hoping I could use it to occupy my 'big boy"" while my kids &amp; I eat. I was expecting it to be a solid ball of treat in the hard rubber holder. It ended up being a semi-flat disc of treat that my dog was able to devour in 10 minutes. The outside holder is definitely strong enough to survive my dog's powerful bite but the treat itself was disappointing. I thought I'd be able to use it while we ate, take it back and give it to him again and again as a training device until my dog learned to not beg and drool everywhere when we eat. The fact that the treat only lasted 10 minutes before he had it out of the holder and completely gone was frustrating</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Josiah pretty much begs for this toy. We call it his favorite little baby snackie toy
Yes it looks like maybe a little toy, and it is but this rubber ring especially with the Starmark treats inside is his always go to.
I also fill up with othrt treats too and almost always squirt some of his toothpaste inside and around the edge and Josiah goes crazy for it.

Friend says the dog love it and it's her favorite toy.  Friend stuffs her dog biscuits in the toy.  I told her I use peanut butter for my dog's bento balls...then I pop them into the freezer.  Best toy ever!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was so disappointed that the toy broke immediately since its advertised as being tough. My dog wasn't going crazy on it either. Just a normal dog interested in the treat inside. I would not recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My little doodle is extremely picky. I've tried nearly every kind of chew recommended to me. From nylabones to Himalayan cheese chews, he rejected it all. He rather chew on plastic (especially squeakers). 
I was dog sitting a pup and her owners packed this in her bag... well my guy snatched it at first sniff and had a blast with it. So of course he got his own and is very happy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves the taste and stayed with it for 3 hours. Love it on rainy days when they get bored because they are stuck indoors. Love the treat holes in the back. It really engages them to extract the treats.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">By no means that I expect this toy to be indestructible! I do have two pit bulls. I expected the treat to last longer than an hour though. It is a very well-built toy it is just not for super chewers. If you have a medium tour that aren't going to eat any treat that is given to them in an hour this is the toy for you. However the toy lasted 1 hour in my house. No there was not two of them eating one I had one of my dogs chewing on one. It is a good toy just not for any large breed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was hoping this would last long because my dog really liked it. Two hours after it arrived at our door it is already destroyed. I’m so disappointed, I need to find something that lasts.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Now, first things first - these are not indestructible. They will wear and tear and, depending on your dog, if they figure out you tear up the inside edge to get the treat out, they’ll die in a few days. 

With the five dogs who’ve used these, that’s literally never happened to me. Long term damage, that built up from regular use over a few weeks, sure, but not within a day. That includes - a pitbull, a boxer mix, a boston terrier (surprisingly the hardest on the toys considering she has like eight teeth left), a very sharp toothed dachsund mix, and a chihuahua mix. 

Next, these are treats. For your really heavy, strong chewers, the treat isn’t going to last more than 30-40 minutes. But if anyone</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog is about 40 pounds and I bought the large, thinking it was a little smaller. He loves it though! He plays with it, nudges it around the room, and most importantly, he gnaws on it to his heart's desire which cleans his teeth and gives him some healthy chewing options.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I would not suggest this for bigger dogs/puppies with larger teeth. It's not ""everlasting"" or ""indestructible"" as advertised. My 7 month old Bernese Mountain Dog puppy chewed through the toy within 30 minutes and digested half of the rubber treat holder. I'm now terrified it may get stuck in his stomach, which may need surgery.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Beau loves his new toy! He plays with it even when there is no treat in it. Our other dog,Chip,even plays with it and he really is not into toys at all!</span>]",extreme,chew toys,https://www.chewy.com/starmark-everlasting-bento-ball/dp/106035

It's been hard to transition her to hard toys, but this Nylabone Hoof has done the trick.

They’re both crazy chewers, and this toy - along with others of the same line - work great for them.

I cannot find many toys he doesn't destroy in minutes, this being one of them. He freaked out when I gave it to him (not even filled) this morning and in about 10 minutes or less he had the corners completed chewed and was breaking pieces off! I won't buy it again since he had destroyed it in minutes but he did love it so 3 stars for us!

My border collie-lab pup is happy when we fill it with PB &amp; shredded carrots (usually we freeze it) and give it to him. The hoof is SUPER solid and much heavier than you would expect.

I read several reviews from those who also said their pups wouldn’t even look at the thing. I am desperate for a chew toy my dog won’t destroy in 5 minutes, so I decided to risk it. Now, I am kicking myself because I’m out nearly $30 on a toy that just sits there...and I finally put it away because I kept stubbing my toe on it. It is HEAVY, which I wonder might be one reason she doesn’t like it. Severely disappointed customer here...</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this for our 10 month old AmStaff who quickly destroys 99% of the toys she is given - including those designed for ""bully breeds"". So far so good on this one. It is quite heavy which may have something to do with why it hasn't ended up in the trash yet. It is harder for her to pick up and carry around and due to the overall size, harder for her to get her jaws around. She does like playing with it though and I am impressed it has lasted more than a week.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was afraid to buy this since it is pretty pricey and my dog destroys everything but I’m so glad I did! I have a 95 lbs pit bull and he destroys everything within 5 minutes. We’ve had this toy for 4 weeks and he hasn’t been able to tear it apart at all! I will recommend this toy to everyone!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I purchased this on 12/5/2018 for for my 50lb pit bull after she chewed through black kong toys within 2 weeks.  After a few days of getting used to the weight..She loves it!  She chews it and plays fetch with it every day.  I think she actually goes through anxiety if she does not know where it is.  It is now the end of July 2020 and it is starting to show a teeny bit of red in the center.  I will be purchasing a replacement.  Definitely worth the price.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is quite heavy and I think would take a very aggressive chewer to make a dent in it. We wanted it for a pool fetch toy. It doesn’t work well for that use as it doesn’t float well. It sinks down with the slightest touch and takes time to return to surface. If your dog likes to go under water then probably a good fit. I’m sure we will have this toy a long time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It is definitely heavy-duty... our dog is a chewer and this thing has barely a mark on it after 2 weeks.  Our dog loves it... she'll play with it, and then when it's in a different room, she'll run out and go find it and bring it to wherever she is.  

We ordered the largest size for our 60lb lab mix.  It's big - not a bad thing... just read carefully which size you're ordering.  We got exactly what we wanted and what we ordered, but for some reason, it didn't seem as big when we ordered it as it ended up being in real life.  The photos would be best to have something like a soda can, tennis ball, coin or something for reference.  

The main concern/complaint we have with it is the odor.  </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have three dogs in our home, including one puppy who loves to chew. None of the dogs will touch this. I am sure it is very indestructible, but the dogs aren’t interested. It does smell intensely of rubber. Even after putting peanut butter on it, they still could care less.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was excited to find this product but my dogs won’t touch it :(  I don’t know if it’s because it smells or what but they do not touch this toy</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 75lb english bulldog and he LOVES it. It doesn’t even tear or break which amazes me. Its rubber but not hard rubber, you can hear him chewing. All the hard toys make his teeth bleed but not this ring. All there is are little dots where his teeth are. He breaks everything in sight so finding a “strong chewer” toy is always impossible. He is obsessed with it and carries it everywhere. Its been a month and he hasnt made a dent. 100% recommend and if you’re ify on spending the money go and buy it! I have no doubts. There is a tougher one that doesn’t float in water as well but this one seemed to do the trick.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our pup has had this toy for almost 7 months, and it is one of the first she hasn’t destroyed. (!!!) Loves to play fetch with it, just carry it around, will intermittently try to chew on it. The shape seems hard to chew &amp; hold onto though, which makes it more fun. She loves to gnaw thru nylabones so we bought this so we wouldn’t have to guess when it was time to trash it. We can hardly see any chew marks on the goughnut so certainly don’t think it is nearing the end of its lifespan.

A big part of why it's hard for a dog to chew through is the diameter of the toy.  Since it's so big around, the dog can't put quite as much pressure on it when he chews.  

I debated between the Maxx and the Maxx50, and ultimately decided on the Maxx.  I'm glad I did--it's a great size for my Rott.  And as heavy as it already is, I'd hate to see an even heavier version.  

I'm not sure I'd say this is his absolutely favorite toy, but he definitely enjoys it.

I have a one year old lab mix who is an aggressive chewer. I thought she would love this because she can pounce on it and roll it around on her own and also chew without destroying. She seems to have no interest in it though. It does look durable though.  Hopefully I can find a way to interest her because I did find it somewhat expensive.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this and the donut style one too, and my power chewers won’t touch either one unless they’re covered in peanut butter. They seem tough and like they would stand up well, but they do have a rubber odor, and they are quite heavy. No fault to the toy itself, I’ve had a lot of recommendations for this brand of toy, so I figured we’d try it. If your dogs like chewing other rubber type toys they might like goughnuts too.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 2 Staffordshire Bull Terriers love playing with the GoughNuts ring toy, so I ordered the ""Stick"" and they love it just as much.  It's more of a challenge for them to use when playing tug-o-war but they play with it alot.  It really smells of rubber, but I'm not complaining.... this is well worth the money for our two big-mouthed babies and their strong jaws.  Highly recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pitbull is a power chewer and, if unsupervised, will continue to gnaw on his toys until they’re in pieces. I bought this toy because I really liked the safety feature that let owners know when to take the toy away, but didn’t expect it to last as long as it has! He loves chewing it, play tug, and fetch with this toy and there isn’t a scratch on it! We didn’t think it would last a day, let alone two weeks (and still intact!), because the rubber seemed soft and he could easily chew it to pieces just like others that came before him. Turns out, it’s just soft enough to be difficult to penetrate its outer barrier! Very happy with this purchase and worth the price tag.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I never write reviews! We got the Maxx version of this stick for my power chewer Northern breed mix, Rigby. He chews on this almost daily for thirty minutes or more. It is virtually unscathed other than some teeth marks. If you have a chewer who has destroyed other rubber toys, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this toy in the black, Maxx version specifically. I will say it is quite heavy so it might not be a big hit with a smaller dog (say less than 40ish pounds?).</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was excited to purchase this for my power chewer.  Within the first day you could see little teeth marks.  His initial response was promising that he would enjoy the stick but that enjoyment has completely dropped off.  I wouldn’t purchase another one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this on a whim because we canceled our BarkBox subscription a few months back and my dog misses getting new toys every month lol. She is a pitbull and will destroy toys in minutes, unless they're the thick rubber material. So I got this one, hoping it would be ok. She absolutely -LOVES- it. It's easy to pull out of her mouth when we play, because it's smooth, and it's dense but not HARD. It has a little flexibility to it. It's sturdy and she hasn't even made any marks on it, which is crazy.

I have a Rottweiler, a full sized labradoodle, and a Springer Spaniel..The spaniel loves to carry this around with him, but NONE of them can get the treats inside out. The ball does appear to be very tough, and the outside grooves are fairly deep. Still, I wouldn't put food in them unless you don't care about crumbs and pieces on your floor. 

One other thing. Starmark makes the ridged cookie that comes with this toy, and also a smooth topped one. My dogs have the ridged one out in minutes. The smooth topped one keeps them busy a lot, lot longer.

It took 10 days to arrive.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This has been a game changer for our 4 year old Rottweiler. She’s an intense chewer and we have a hard time finding toys that she can’t destruct in 15 minutes. The treat went quick because she was determined to get it but the actual toy has stood up to her!

It came with a treat in the top and it took him quite some time to get it all out, longer than a Kong, longer than any treats or toys we have tried so far. He worked on it for a couple of hours and then there was still some under the rim that it took him a few days to get all of. I cleaned it and now it has a longer stick style treat in the center through both holes and treats, peanut butter and soft food in the top with peanut butter and treats in the ridges on the outside and peanut butter on the bottom as well and it's in the freezer.
