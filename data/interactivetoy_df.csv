There are so many different flavors of both liquid/paste based treats and solid treats that you can purchase for your pups, you're sure to find a flavor every dog will enjoy. Also, if you're on a budget, you can simply buy some peanut butter and spread it around the inside with a kitchen knife. Saves your house from teething destruction and they are also the best tool I have found for separation anxiety. Even my adult dogs get one right before I leave the house, and they don't even care that I'm leaving.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Just got this today and I know it's goofy to write a review right away about an item/purchase BUT(!) I tested it out as soon as I got home with my dog - he's usually iffy about toys or anything that is NOT food... I filled it with the cheese &amp; Bacon spray and he just went to town! Absolutely loves it. I've been thinking about getting one of these for a while but finally gave in and happy I did!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the perfect size for a puppy.  Only complaint was I ordered pink and received blue.  Puppy didn't mind but the owner gave me a hard time (jokingly).  Puppy loved it and it does keep her entertained when owner needs quiet time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Smaller than I expected and I ordered a size bigger than what I was expecting. Other than that it’s good, my dog likes it as a treat.
I put kibble in it, wet it, then freeze it but you don’t need to freeze it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Even as a puppy, my dog was quite a chewer. And, as most puppies do, she had absolute razor-blade teeth. She would poke holes in this and rip pieces of rubber off of it. Before it was damaged, it was really useful to cram full of peanut butter and freeze for her to get out when she was having separation anxiety.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It doesn't save the fingers and hands from sharp tiny milk teeth but, Yellow Dog loves to toss it around and make it bounce and chase after it and chew on it, lol! So energy outlet wise it is a great toy from puppies!!! :D</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Finally, a really tiny chew toy for my Pug puppy.  She will actually be able to grab it and it is indeed softer than the standard Kong,  I ordered the small as well because she may grow out of this tiny XSmall one quickly but it is the perfect starter!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is his favorite Kong. We ordered it in blue (for a boy) . Although, when I called customer service to request the blue one, they told me they can not guarantee the color that will come. It DID arrive in blue!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Chihuahua/Pug mixed babies are massive chewers. Most of the items I give to them are destroyed in a few hours (or less). They love the challenge of getting their treats, and they are easily cleaned and sanitized. Hooray for me AND my babies!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This puppy kong is easy for my 12 lb girl to carry around and chew. I wish it was a bit shorter because she can't get the squeeze cheese or peanut butter and the end of the treat. It's really difficult to clean, but I will keep using it because it holds treats well and she loves it!</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/kong-puppy-dog-toy-color-varies-small/dp/38488,treat toys & dispensers,interactive toys

It provides some much needed mental stimulation for my 6 month Dalmatian puppy and she LOVES it! She will carry it from room to room with her to chew on. She loves the everlasting treat inserts but they only last maybe two days with an hour or two of chewing per day. Also by the end she can usually get out a big hunk of treat at a time and I worry that she doesn’t chew it enough so I hope it’s easily digestible! The bonus is that you can shove additional treats in the bottom. I like to put frozen carrots or blueberries in the bottom so she really has to work to get them out. Keeps her entertained even longer than the insert treats! So overall a really good treat ball,</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have 3 big dogs and bought these hoping the would chew them...that they did and got them out of the holder within a couple minutes! Was hoping they would do the normal and chew; one did but she even busted the rubber and got the middle ""everlasting chew"" out and then chowed down on it. They love it so i gave 2 stars but definitely not worth the $ if you're dog is a motivated dog or a huge chewer when it comes to something like a treat. This is maybe an hour after we got it...the rubber outside didn't hold up either! They got them discs out of the rubber and gone!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I gave this to my 45 lb puppy with some kibble in the treat side and the treat that came with the bento ball in place. She LOVES it! She's been working on it for a little over an hour - and the treat is about half done, but she already tore one side of the ball out so she could just gnaw on the treat.

Disappointing, since she doesn't like chewing hard toys, so I thought this could work for more than one use.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loved this toy, and the treat was a good dental chew. However, on the third or fourth day of giving it to him, I looked over and saw he had eaten a large chunk of the rubber (see photo below). He's a strong chewer for sure, but he is under 35 pounds, so this toy should not be advertised as virtually indestructible or for strong chewers. If you've got a dog that isn't quite as strong, though, this toy would be excellent for them for hours of entertainment.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was worried that my 100+ lb shredder pupper would destroy the rubber as others reviewed. However, after seeing one of these bad boys at my friends place (with 7 crazy dogs), I decided to invest in one.  No damage has been done! My other concern was if my dog would even like the treat that it came with (he is spoiled and picky with new things). At first I paired the everlasting treat with some of his Rachael Ray’s Soup bones (stored it in the other side). He didn’t seem to like it at first. Then I decided to rinse off any possible residue on the top of it first. Now I have to monitor how long he has a treat for. He will go at it until he’s out of breath and tired. This treat could’ve probably</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">At first I was kinda worried seeing as other dogs have taken chunks from this toy. My Oakley is a very big chewer and I wanted something to deter him from chewing my clothes, or jumping up against the counter, and trying to take stuff that isn’t his. As soon as I pulled this out of the packaging I haven’t seen him go for anything he’s not supposed to. Will be getting some replacement treats for this toy because he’s loving it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I purchased my first Bento Ball from my local pet boarding/daycare facility. Was told is would last for a long time to help with boredom. Mi Mini Goldendoodle had it eaten within about a hour. 
I thought I’d get a different one and maybe it would last. And it lasted about 2 hours. 
Of course that is longer but was not as long as described. No way it would last 6-8 hours. The holder would be destroyed by then. I will continue to use them but wish it was a little more sturdy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Bloodhound Ellie loves this toy! Whenever I put in a new treat it's her go to toy keeps her occupied for about 15 to 20 minutes (which is really good for her). I have filled with the Starmark Everlasting Chicken with the rounded top, but I've used the other chicken flavored and the ridged one as well. She loved them too I just order the liver one to see if she likes it as well.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this because my dog loves to chew. It is advertised to be indestructible but my dog determined that false. This was after only having it about 30 minutes. The rubber casing around the bone part is actually pretty soft compared to normal chewers. One the rubber part is messed up the bone part becomes pointless. I don’t think it’s a terrible toy but I do think it is marketed falsely, not everlasting, and didn’t last “hours”, “virtually indestructible” false!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We adopted a 9 year old beagle pup in January, and quickly learned that he didn't really know how to play. He doesn't understand fetch, and doesn't really like to chew anything that's not food. However, I wanted to find something to keep him busy when we aren't outside enjoying a walk. This toy fit's the bill! Our pup isn't really interested in licking the large treat, but he loves pushing the ball around with his nose trying to get smaller treats out. He's gotten so good at it that it only takes him a few minutes to get every last bite out! I wished it lasted a bit longer, but I'm just happy he's excited about a toy!</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/starmark-everlasting-treat-bento-ball/dp/45443,treat toys & dispensers,interactive toys

I expected this one to be made of something soft and pliable; it is hard plastic. The toy has removable pieces inside to create varying degrees of difficulty. I removed two of the pieces so there was only one hole in the middle piece and one hole in the outer wall of the ball that the food had to make it thru. Roxy was very frustrated that the ball didn't bounce and she couldn't get a good grasp on it to shake it for the food to come out. She ended up unscrewing the two halves to get at the food. Yay, I guess that this Weim was smart enough to do that but she hasn't picked it up to play with since her initial try.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 9 year old korean jindo. They are in the spitz family (akitas, shibas, huskies, etc.) and as with other spitz types, they tend to be independent, stubborn, and intelligent. That being said this is a great toy to keep my dog occupied. She pretty much immediately started rolling it around once I showed her how it worked (started without any of the disks inside). I use kibble to make dinner time more interesting for her. Jindos were bred for hunting so this is a great way for her to ""hunt"" for reward without me struggling to keep her focused. She even comes to get me if the ball is stuck or empty.

I currently have her on one disc out of the three you can put inside to slow the treats. </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Watson our 5 month old puppy loves this toy! He is rambunctious and loves biting us over any of his toys. But this toy keeps him entertained for awhile. He’s also easily startled around loud sounds so the fact that it rolls around the hardwood floors is helping him get used to all those noises. He doesn’t give up until every piece is out. Once he gets to the last ones he’ll pick it up with his mouth and chew on it so I do watch him at that point and remind him to use his paw. He’ll do anything for his food. Seriously worth every penny!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I also love this. I have a two month old puppy and i put her food in this and give it to her in her crate. She loves it so much that she even plays with the toy when there's nothing in it. I usually up the difficulty and if it's too hard for get out all the food she'll wait patiently and i will remove one of the plastic parts to make it easier and then will give it back to her to try again. It doesn't take her hours but still gives me a good 15 minute break. It has really helped with crate training.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have tried numerous treat dispensing toys including other balls that were not see through and my dogs would just ignore it but they love this one. I love how it has the inner pieces to make it more challenging. The inner pieces can actually be taken apart or totally taken out to increase or decrease the challenge. I started out with taking out the inside pieces and adding the pieces back as it got easier for them.They have blast chasing it around. I use cheerios and a few ""stinky"" treats to motivate them and they love it. This is also the only toy my older dog will play with.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Jack Russell just loves this! it is very strong, sturdy for zooming around the house. He even brings it to me at 730pm, when it's 'Busy Ball' time. can put in dishwasher also. Have extra in case this one finally dies, but he's had it over 2 years! Highly recommend for rainy days or expected play time. also, I don't feed extra. he gets 1/2 cup kibble 2x day. I reserve some to put in this at night. He may think he's getting extra, but, he isn't!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Both my dogs loved this toy so much, I bought a second so they could each have one. Has held up to my VERY aggressive chewing staffie and my 80lb pit mix. My mix likes more intellectual toys and plays with it longer than my staffie as the treats don’t dispense quite as easily as others we have. That is great for wearing out an intellectual dog. Staffie loves it just fine for a bit but then chooses to move onto something she can chew.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Got this for my coon hound pup, he’s 4 months. He loves this toy. I just fill it with dog food, keeps him occupied for hours. My adult lab also loves it. Only downside is that it can be kind of annoying as my pup zings in across our wood floors and into the walls and furniture, would probably be perfect for carpeted areas. Overall very satisfied with this.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Such a fun toy for my dog to interact with (once he realized how it worked). It's a laugh to watch them run around after it for treats. Definitely recommend! My dog even stops it now from rolling under the couch and brings it back to the center of the room to knock it around with his paws or nose again. It's supposed to entertain them but I end up watching him play for so long.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So, I bought this for my goats.... They are super curious creatures.  First 5 minutes out of the package it was filled with raisins (my goats' favorite treat) and the three of them were off and rolling.

This ball has withstood hours of playtime this summer and I can’t recommend it enough.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a heavy chewer. We had already purchased the pickle from the same company. He really does go to town on that one but it’s lasted quite a while so we decided to try this one. We did end up having to take out some of the nubs on one end so his treats can fall out a little easier. Other than that, it’s still going strong with him. He’s a 20 pound terrier mix and usually able to destroy everything. Yay</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My senior rescue chi loves this food dispensing toy.  The only issue I have with it is something not related to the quality of the toy.  She is on a rx diet now. I was previously putting small kibble into it.  Now, I have to take her Hills treat...crunch it up and it doesn't dispense the treat as easily.  But its cute and worth the effort on my part to watch her have fun.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Pittie and Beagle puppy loved this toy so much, I had to buy another one so that they would stop fighting over who could play with it. Dispenses food easily when rolled and durable, although I do like to watch them play with it (especially my Pittie, who can probably bite a hole into after a few hours). Also comes with a light vanilla scent which is great.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I put a little peanut butter and some kibble and a treat or two and my dog will occupy herself for 1-2 hours. best toy ever I will repurchase more when she breaks it. seems very sturdy though and she likes it more than a kong. It rolls away from her so she has to try harder, she can eat a whole frozen kong in maybe 15 minutes easily. 10000% recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this toy from PetSmart like a year ago he still has it they say dogs are color-blind but when I brought this ball home he was so happy cuz of the color any other ball or toy that isn't green he will not even touch he just nudges so when they say dogs are color-blind I really find that funny because his favorite color is green</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our American Bully is an extreme chewer destroying many toys within a few hours.  We have had the chew ball for about a month and to this point we have yet to see any punctures on the treat dispenser.  It engages her for long periods of time when we put her kibble in for mental enrichment.  Great product!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have tried quite a few treat dispensing toys, but this is was a clear winner for my  10 yr old, 12 lb Poodle mix. Its small enough that he can carry to his favorite spot of the couch. Its soft enough so its not loud, noisy. The customizable opening option allows me to make the ball easier for my dog to get the treats. I put smaller pieces of freeze dried beef liver. My dog has a great time trying to get the treats out.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is wonderful we can put it in very small pieces and either play catch with our Bentley or leave it for him as a treat when we leave him at home. 
He does not seem interested in destroying this. That alone gives it a five star review from us</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/starmark-treat-dispensing-chew-ball/dp/45447,treat toys & dispensers,interactive toys

If other food toys are out smarted or destroyed by your dog- BUY THIS ONE!

My Aussie/heeler outsmarts or destroys most of the “interactive toys” much to my wallet’s dismay. The last food ball I bought she would roll around her bolster bed instead of the floor. With her other food toys she’ll hold them and unscrew them. 

This toy has officially outworked her. SCORE!

The toy is bottom heavy making it easy to fill and making the dog actually work for the food. They have to bobble or push it to get any food. It is made of a plastic that is hard and durable but not brittle. 

This toy is not obnoxiously loud on hard floors like many others. (If your dog can throw it</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I wanted to give it 5 stars. It is a great products and perfect for a busy dog. We got the large one for our sheepadoodle puppy and it took him a little while to figure it out. Although when he did it only took him a few minutes to clear it out. We feed him lunch in it most days to get some of his energy out and he loves it. If you have a smart dog as soon as they learn how it works it won’t take much. I’d give it 5 stars if it took him longer to clean out, maybe when we switch to adult dog food where the pieces are a little bigger.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 50lb Catahoula girl absolutely loves it! She is crazy about food, and can eat all of her food from a slow feeder bowl in under two minutes. With this, it takes her about 15 minutes to completely empty it. She has more difficult food/treat dispensing toys but that take her longer, but I like that I can fit her whole meal in this and not have to refill it. Heavy chewers should not be left alone with it though. she doesn't chew on it other than to pick it up and move it, and after a week the top is pretty cut up. It'd be easy for her to take a chunk out of the plastic if she wanted to.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Keeps my crazy lab busy during breakfast and dinner. I usually split his kibble portion in half in his slow feeder and feed him in his wobbler kong outside to keep him busy. The kong is huge so if you have a big dog, get the large. My lab thought this was a toy and started to chew on the top, but eventually figured out that it dispenses treats/kibble. It's entertaining watching him use his nose and paws to get the treats out of the toy. Definitely would recommend this to prolong feeding times and also keep you pup mentally and physically stimulated.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my third slow feeder, and I actually love this one (and so does my pup). All the martial is a hard plastic and the bottom screws off for easy, thorough cleaning. The opening in the side is large enough for the large pieces of kibble to easily fall out without getting jammed, but still requiresb our pup to put in some effort to get his food.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our big boy figured this toy out quickly and can’t get enough of it! It’s larger than I expected but I don’t mind and neither does he. We get a larger kibble so usually only 3-4 pieces max fall out at once, which slows mealtime down nicely. He doesn’t give up till he’s got every bit out. It’s a pretty firm plastic, unlike most kong chew toy types, but there’s no edge for him to really try and chew except for the hole for the treats. He hasn’t been able to break it and he’s a power chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This unscrews to place the treats inside. We had one years ago and our dogs ignored it. Not so with our newest Dane/Mastiff. Not only is she occupied for long periods with this, but she manages to get it unscrewed no matter how tight we screw it together. A true joy to watch her struggles.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This Kong is awesome! When you need some time to decompress after a long day,  this toy will keep you baby busy! We all love our furbabbies but there are times you just need a few minutes to yourself. I love all the kisses I get from my boy. When he sees me putting kibble in this Kong, he gets so excited! Believe me, you and your baby will love it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My coonhound is really enjoying this toy. I use it to feed most of his meals and find it to be more effective than a slow feed bowl. The only thing I have to watch out for is that sometimes if he can't get the last bit out he'll get frustrated and start chewing the top.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/kong-wobbler-dog-toy-large/dp/44195,treat toys & dispensers,interactive toys

She will take it, chew the ends, roll on her back and hold it with her two paws in the air to see if something will fall out. It keeps her super busy and motivated as we walk out the door. It is always empty when we get home. It's her favorite toy. I like to give it as a gift too.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This began to crumble in my dogs mouth within the first few minutes of play.  It wasn't the result of aggressive chew, rather, the result of a defective product.  You can tell because it started to break off in smooth geometric patters rather than his teeth-shape.  I'm really disappointed in this and for the first time EVER, the KONG brand.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this thinking it would last as a toy for my bullys to play with during the day while they are out side and I’m doing chores. within the first day they had it tore up. I have the big round ones that are amazing but if you have a chewer i do not recommend this toy for them. Other wise my dogs loved it! It is good for fetch!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Guess my dog was too tough for this toy. I purchased 2, because I have 2 lab mix rescues and within a day they both had chewed the ends off. I was afraid they would swallow the pieces so I took them away from them. Guess I need a tougher toy. These might work for smaller dogs or not aggressive chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Was very disappointed with this KONG toy. My pup had it for no more than 10 minutes when the rubber started flaking off into tiny pieces. I guess this toy isn't intended for dogs that are chewers? Bummer since we have really liked all other KONG items we have purchased</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this toy for my fury kids. It's very challenging and keeping them occupied for a long time. However, the combination of the shape of the toy and their hard-working saliva attracts almost everything on the floor and carpet. Each time when they play with this toy, I need to wash it thoroughly to make sure nothing is inside and out. Otherwise, its a great concept!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This Kong seems to have gotten a bit sturdier since we bought the same one a few years ago. This is probably a good thing, since the old one succumbed to my dog's modest chewing. He works a little harder on this one to get his biscuit out -- also a good thing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So maybe my shepherd lab isn’t a genius, but it’s so tough to get treats out of this thing! The only way is for your dog to chew hard on the toy which breaks up the kibble/treats, while the fall out the sides in tiny specks that you have to vacuum up later. I tried shoving a rawhide bone in there which kept her entertained for a long time (and even left bite marks on it), but the bottom was so stuck it eventually took me prying the soggy thing out with a spoon. Solution: on one side I cut one of the flaps off, and now it’s perfect. She can roll it and flip it around and eventually food will come out without her losing interest.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Did not last even 5 minutes. I never even had a chance to put treats in it. My pup destroyed this toy! Power chewers beware it will not hold like the actual Kongs do. Very disappointed in this king toy. Should have looked through more of the reviews.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is huge and extremely durable but not for aggressive chewers.

Believe it. I put some treats in it for my 6 month old 85lb German Shepherd puppy. I was hoping he would like the wobble effect and figure out it would dispense treats. He did not.

This might be good if your dog is old enough not to immediately chew anything given him.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I love how you can make two adjustments to this toy in order to make it more difficult.

The top is the part in yellow in the photo. The smallest treats I have (really kibble) never came out of the hole. As I thought she was knocking it about to get at the treats, she instead chewed it until the top edges were coming apart, with little chunks of plastic falling off. I got it because it was “recommended” for this dog, who loves the Kong StuffaBall and the Orange moon-looking treat ball. It took less than 15-20 minutes to destroy this $20 toy. The top won’t go off &amp; on now, so I can’t try using it for the other dog or giving it away - it’s literally trash.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog needs inside activities and loves food and foraging.  This is the third such toy I’ve tried and it works from his standpoint AND MINE.  Keeps his attention for over half an hour per fill-up (of his dinner kibble).  Release holes are adjustable for different size kibble and difficulty.   And, from my point of view, he can’t find anything on it to chew and break/crack.  Great toy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a picky eater. She likes her kibble but is finicky about when she eats it. I found by putting her food in the bobble toy it keeps her busy and entertained while eating her food. I'll put a bowl of food next to the bobble toy and she'll always choose the bobble toy over the bowl of food to eat. So heads up to all those doggo parents with picky eaters this helped us!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was looking for a toy that would keep my girl occupied, she acts like she’s bored half the time... I was iffy on buying this because it was close too 30$ but it is worth it!!! Ever since we got it that’s all she’s been playing with.. I just put a handful of treats at a time:.. you can adjust how big the whole is that the treats come out of, until your dog gets use to it you’ll have to turn the hole as big as it can go and I cut down treats to make them pretty small for now until she gets a better hang of it... I give it a 10/10, yes she has chews marks on the yellow top already from carrying it around to different spots but it doesn’t effect the toy</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I love these things. I have had severe over the years (when you have a 120 lb chewier they will only last so long). They do last several years, instead of several months or weeks like most things.

If you have a food hound that needs to be busy all the time this is the thing. He loves it and loves working for his food.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This would be a super treat/kibble toy if only it easily opened. The only way to fill it is to put one piece of kibble in at a time through the tiny hole. And if you don't have a dishwasher, the only way to clean it is to soak it, rinse with hot water, and wait 2 days for it to dry out. Otherwise, our dog loves it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have numerous dog toys and puzzle. This is one I use a lot. I find it cumbersome to fill but it can hold at least 2 cups of kibble. I like that the hole the kibble falls out of can be adjusted to the size of the kibble. It is very sturdy and durable. My dog literally picks it up and throws it at times. It's still in one piece.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Was surprised at how sturdy this thing is!

Well my dog's kibble is probably a quarter the size of the hole or less. So I will have to find a safe way to plug that hole so only the slotted hole will dispense kibble. But she can't chew on this or pick it up. She just pushes it around. Its not much fun. Waste of money. Why arent there smaller dispensers for like chihuahuas and toy breeds?</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pup, who is an Australian Cattle mix, loves having this for food! She does take a good amount of time to eat it which is great because even with a slow bowl, she ends up burping from eating too fast.

I drop a handful of her kibble in it- that keeps her entertained for about 10 mins. I like that it is not hard plastic.

I have done everything the vet suggested to get the weight off but she’s not a very active girl and with the heat and humidity being so high for so long our walks have become shorter. This ball has gotten her up and running after it for hours daily. She begs for it and enjoys it greatly and it’s awesome entertainment for me!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a great treat dispenser, even for my cats. They obviously don't chew on it like a dog would, but it doesn't spill the treats everywhere and give them too many at once. They have to work for it.

But on the second day, he quickly chewed off 2 arms as you can see in the photo. My disappointment is increased mainly because the toy seemed to be perfect for him.

We'd smear them with peanut butter and, to make them last even longer, stick them in the freezer prior to handing them out. But, we have two heavy-duty chewers, so the toys started to crack after about five or six uses. To be honest, I can't say if the cracking was due to our chewers, the freezing process, or the fact that I washed them in the dishwasher.

Unfortunately, once our Golden couldn't figure out how to get more treat out, he started ripping on the tire ridges. I was unsurprised, since, when I opened the package, I thought the tire felt soft, but I did find it surprising considering the marketing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I liked the idea of this toy but my dog didn’t like it. After a a couple days she did eat the treat that came with it. No obvious chewing of the rubber toy though. I replaced the treat and she never touched the toy again. The treat did have a very weird sweet smell to it. I had left the treat in the garage and whenever I went in there I could smell it. My dog literally tries to eat garbage and isn’t picky at all. Maybe some different flavors would be better?</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Not sure why there are so many negative reviews regarding the smell. Not sure if they are talking about the rubber or the treat. I washed the rubber just because thats what I do with new stuff. The rubber nor the treat have an odor. Sometimes my dog is able to work the puck out of the tire but when he doesn't it keeps him busy for hours. I have a size medium for my miniature poodle and a large for my lab mix. This chew works well for us.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Try as I do to find a toy that can live up to its claims, I can’t. The only toy that has lasted so far is the black, extra tough Kongs. My guy had the entire top of the treat gone within 20 minutes. It took him another 40 to begin biting off pieces. He gets so excited to have new toys and though we have to take them away. So that was $$$ wasted! Very disappointed!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">our dogs love this toy/snack. This snack will keep the Dog busy licking and playing with the indestructible rubber tire. It is refillable so it has a long life. Our dogs eat everything. This is still around and still fun for them. Money well spent on dog toys. Our puppy carries it around the house and our older dog follows her.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this to replace one I have had for a while. Out of the package it had an overly sweet fake vanilla scent. My dog ate up the treat and enjoyed removing it, however, it made him sick to his stomach. He used to bring me the old one all the time hoping for a treat but he hasn’t touched this one since the first night. The treats have never caused a problem before so I am guessing it was whatever was put on the wheel itself to give that smell. I am disappointed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a great idea for a toy but it didn't work out for us. First of all, it smells really bad and the odor is so strong, it has to stay outside. Like fake vanilla. Some folks might like that but I don't. It's so strong it clings to rugs and surfaces. Yuck. One of my two dogs was interested in it as an outside toy for a while but once the ridges got flattened from licking and chewing, she lost interest. Now it's just a stinky neglected piece of rubber hanging around stinking up my yard. Yup, after being outside for several weeks it just keeps on reeking. Next stop, the trash.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this for my bernedoodle. He had it started in pieces within a day. It's now a million tiny pieces. I am only getting toys that say they are ""tough"" but so far, have been sorely disappointed! He's definitely a tough chewer and this did not stand up to his chewing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Just another toy added to the long list of hundreds of dollars spent on toys. Another toy marketed for extreme chewers that lasted my dog all of 30 minutes before the actual rubber itself was shredded. The treat center held up 15. Very disappointed in this toy, and once again I’m on the search for something that will last my dog longer than 2 hours.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My young greyhound attacked this with enthusiasm and kept at it until she worked the treat free. And she ate the whole thing. The replacement treats are a little expensive for me if they only last a half-hour.

Shes a sucker for any toy that rolls so this toy really entertains her. It really does tease her because she wants to get to the ball inside but it rolls away from her so she has to chase it and try again. The product is plastic so I can definitely see that if not monitored she could probably chew right through it. Although I’m not too worried right now since she gets tired from it rolling away from her and takes a break. Score! (Sometimes I can’t play so this toy is awesome) I got a size small and she is about 45lbs, perfect size for her to hold. Shipping was fast as well, thanks chewy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is obsessed with this ball. He loves to play soccer around the yard with this yipping and barking as he tries to get the inside ball. Once he tires out he will lay down and try to pull the small ball out. This toy was originally bought for another dog who didn’t have interest in it, but mine absolutely loves it. He has had this toy for over a year and a half - and spent a lot of time trying to get it apart and has just succeeded! He plays with both pieces still. He is a super chewer but surprisingly it took time to chew through this toy. This was well worth the money and will be buying again. Great to play with your dog with and to occupy your dog in its own.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our girl, Nagi Bear has zero interest in this ball. Which is a real bummer because it was suggested to me for our super chewer. Unfortunately, when we opened it and gave it to her she just pushed it around for a few seconds with her nose and walked away. The next morning I took it outside to the yard to see if kicking it around would entice her but still no interest. She found more joy sniffing the grass blades individually, lol. This is probably a great toy for some, Nagi Bear just didn't get it. I gave it two stars for durability and speed of shipment.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a Belgian Malinois so to say he needs tough toys that keep him entertained is an understatement. We love this ball because it actually keeps him very entertained, he will run around with it all day. 
I would say the only problem for me is the weight, my dog slams it into the fence and it’s broken a couple fence boards in half. 
I definitely will buy it again, I’ll probably just not leave it in the yard for him unsupervised.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This states on the box it is not a chew toy. It is not. My large 6 month old German Shepherd puppy enjoyed this for a short time but when he realized the inside ball would not come out he got bored with it and would start to chew it or pick it up and carry it along and drop it and ignore it. It’s hard plastic so you do have to watch your dog with it that he doesn’t chew the plastic into sharp edges.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball would be great for dogs who don’t grip down super tight on it. We have two German Shepherds and they like the ball but in just a few days, put groves in the hard plastic leaving sharp edges all over it. We are concerned they might get cut on the edges. On a positive side it is a fun ball for our shepherd who holds another toy in his mouth and plays with the ball as if he were playing soccer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My two-year-old lab has destroyed many toys in just minutes. She’s had this magical blue ball for about four months, and is still completely enraptured. Just infatuated by it. It’s sturdy enough to handle her teeth and interesting enough to keep her focus for HOURS on end. Chesler is extremely social and usually jumps on people when they come in the house. But when people come over to hang out in the yard, I give her this magical blue ball and she couldn’t care less about the visitors. It’s a great party trick, because no one has ever seen a dog so transfixed. It is my only rival for the position of her best friend, and I’m totally okay with that.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">He really enjoys playing with this in the yard. He is a super chewer and this does the trick to occupy him, but I'm worried that the bite marks on the plastic are going to cut his mouth. Kind of wish the plastic was thicker (like kong material).</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a very busy Corgi puppy. She enjoys playing with this altho she isn’t super fascinated by it. It is sturdy and will hold up to her hard chewing. She can make a bit of racket throwing it about as the outer ball is hard plastic. If you live in an apartment and your dog really goes nuts playing with it this could be something to be aware of. It helps keep her occupied tho.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Sorry to say my two fur loves do not like the teaser ball . Maybe it’s the hard plastic ??

The slots are too shallow and the treats come out very easily. You have to have a tiny, tiny treat as I do but they still are too easy to get out.

She has learned to nudge the ball with her nose to dislodge treats and when we bounce it for her, she scans the impact radius for her “reward”.

He’s been able to chew some chunks off the end of this one though.

Then, I tried thinner bully sticks and they also fell through. Greenie type chews are also too thick. Sigh... I am not giving up though. I just need to find the right sized product for the middle. The dogs enjoyed them but obviously they can’t get out the hammered in bully sticks so they presently aren’t suiting our need but will keep looking for a perfect product for the middle. Too expensive to give up on these but honestly  if they were cheaper I probably would call it a loss and donate them. Therefore, I am on the fence as to </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These, along with the Kong, are my dogs' favorite interactive toys. I insert either a fish skin (The Honest Kitchen wolfish skins) or Triumph salmon and sweet potato jerky treats in the large size toy. The fish skins work in both the medium and large toy, depending on the width of the treat. It seems like these toys are indestructible.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This keeps my dog occupied longer than a frozen Kong. I put a medium sized whimzee about half way in it and then add some nutro crunchy treats and mini milkbones. I seal the end and side holes with PB. My dog figured out quick that as soon as she got the PB off the bigger hole of a kong that she could just pick it up and drop it and the treats would fall out. We give her one of these in the morning when we go to work and she usually has the whimzee finished but has not gotten all the small treats out inside. Really good puzzle toy. They’re also dishwasher safe so they’re super easy to clean! We love them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 70lb pit bull who is now 10 years old and has always been a super powerful chewer. I have had many toys for him over the years and had my doubts at first but this has become my go to toy for him and I have recommended it so many times now to other people. It is the longest lasting toy he has ever had. It does get full of teeth marks after a while and sometimes small pieces may come off but he doesn’t bother with them and they are small. Overall it stays in tact and lasts a very long time. I always make sure I have a spare to switch out when it gets rough looking. He loves this toy. It is worth a try if you are looking to entertain your powerful chewer!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We LOVE west paw! Everything lasts forever but this product which should be one of the more tough toys. We put bully sticks and Real Dog Box chews in here so my pit mix really works to get them out. I have to buy a new one every 3/4 months but I will do it forever. Big fan of this thing!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Great product, we tear up one jerky treat and slide it in the grooves and this makes a regular treat last 30 minutes or longer versus if he had it alone. He mostly disregards it when there's no food in it but that's not when we use it. Comparable to a kong, but the dog has to work harder for this.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My bully mix loved this toy - absolutely obsessed with it. It lasted about three days before he started pulling chunks off of it. 
It is a great toy for treats but I wouldn't recommend it for tough chewers, especially unsupervised.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We buy West Paw because they are the only toy to withstand our chewers in fostering.  I bought large for our large breeds, but small would've been good enough since it is quite heavy.  They still love them. All our dogs love them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Works well for my smaller dog for bully stick or split antler, but a more aggressive chewer will pull a bully stick out of slots.

I bought a few treat dispensing toys to hopefully engage them all. My aussie is so obsessed with this toy when I put a treat inside, she will play nonstop. She doesn't even put it down to bark. lol.. She will literally bark with the toy in her mouth and carry it out with her to potty.  We put a small piece of pupperoni in the middle with a thicker treat on each end, so it stays in there and is more challenging.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/west-paw-qwizl-tough-treat-dispensing/dp/141278,treat toys & dispensers,interactive toys

I thought I'd try this with the Nook ball, and with the Nook ball or alone it is indeed much harder and more challenging for the dog -- which is perfect. However, the Snoop and Nook aren't really for power chewers. If I left my dog alone with them, I'm pretty sure they'd be annihilated inside of 10 minutes. I still like this toy a lot, but I have to watch the dog with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Sadly my super chewer loved this a little too much. She was really entertained by it for 25 mins. That’s may have been 5 mins too long. She chewed holes right through it. I’m sad because I really liked it because it was a challenge for her. If I had it to do all over again, I’d let her have it for 10 mins at a time and keep my eyes on her. Good news is no pieces came off, so it seems safe.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a nice and challenging treat toy for your chew driven smarty-pants pup. Our 30lb Aussie-Doxie mix played with this for about 2 hours today and the material looks brand new after. We tested the size of the treats and they all seem fairly difficult to get out which makes it the perfect distraction. Just make sure to watch them and help them get a treat every so often if they aren't very good at first.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">First off, Planet Dog is one of my favorite brands bc the materials they use are non-toxic—I feel comfortable knowing that my boy isn’t being exposed to harmful chemicals while he plays with their toys. 
Im always looking for interactive toys for my boy to keep his mind busy and also slow him down with the treats. I like the Snoop bc he really does have to work for the treats—they dont just easily poor out like some other toys.  My one concern is the safety of the Snoop—he has a narrower snout (like between a GSD and greyhound) and his jaw fits like a glove inside—I worry he might get stuck. Bc of this I do not feel comfortable leaving him alone with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">this toy is great! keeps my boy active and engaged. he continues to chase it around even after he gets all the treats out. i also bought the happy face insert to give him more of a challenge (he is very smart!) and I feel good that its made in the USA. just purchased a few more items from planet dog and he is loving those too.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My puggle Pugsley likes to play with anything that he can get his mouth around.
This chew toy is great for him to get treats or just to bite and throw around.  also likes to use it as a fetch toy.   It has taken a real beating since I got it for him.  I highly recommend it for those pets who are roughnecks like my little boy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My girls love, seriously love these treat balls! I love that I can actually get inside to wash the inside well, versus a hard dispenser ball. Also its so easy to get open (from a human standpoint) in order to release a treat. Fortunately I've had it now for a couple weeks and they have not figured out (or maybe its physically not possible) for them to unbend the rubber to release a treat. My girls (90 lb dobies) are not huge chewers, so no missing rubber or teeth marks. However it is softer material, albeit VERY thick, so if your dogs a big destroyer of softer material maybe not for you? But I think the quality is there even for a chewer. I like that they can fit the underside of their mouth </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This holds up to our tough chewer (German Shepherd) and stimulates him for a long time to get some energy out without needing us to entertain him.  Also, it is easy enough to clean but not good for small treats as they will fall through the hole on the top easily.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I know it's a little expensive but this is totally worth it. We always ""hide"" treats for my dog (Labrador, ~6yr old, 75lb) when we leave for work and this one has kept him occupied the longest. I've tried many other ""hide a treat"" toys and he has figured them all out, either by pulling apart the toy or throwing it around, but this one takes him much longer! Depending on the size and ""crunch"" of the treat, it could take him a half hour to get it out. It's a good quality material, I don't think he'll be able to chew through it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 7 month old standard poodle. Definitely a chewer, but generally not destructive. Loaded this thing with treats and gave to the dog so that we could eat dinner in peace.

So if you’re looking for a treat dispenser I do not recommend but as a toy, it is worth it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">A sturdy, good quality, interactive toy that duke would have taken to the mat, no problem, a few years back. He is 11 now and his teeth prevent him from manipulating the sturdy rubber. If your dog has the ability, it's a great toy because they not only have to get the mouth open but it rolls so they have to use soccer moves too.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have an 11month old German Shepard and lab mix. He can destroy a toy in no lie less than 20 mins. This toy I’ve had for MONTHS. It definitely has lasted even during his chewing stage.

If you put smaller treats obviously more will come out at once. If you have a clever dog then they will figure it out very quickly. My dog is a medium/small Boston Terrier so no issues as others reported with jaw getting stuck. Watch your pets and shouldn’t have any issues. Only  reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because it does let a few to many treats out with small treats (just find something larger as I did and it correct that problem) and it is a simple pattern and the pups figured it out really quick. Outside of that seems to be great.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Very disappointed in this food dispensing toy.  My nine week old puppy found this toy to be far too easy and could empty it in just a few minutes.  Defeated the purpose of keeping my puppy occupied!

My puppy liked that he could easily pick it up, but that’s the only good thing about it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">When it is too hot or too rainy to get my dogs a good run in, I use treat toys to help release built up energy.

My friends 2 year old picked it up and dropped it and it snapped. I was super bummed</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was very disappointed with this item.  Maybe it was my dog but it was destroyed within an hour.  I have ordered similar products in the past and was very pleased.  Not so much with this one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this to entertain my girl on her ""hyper"" days. She is a 85 lb bloodhound mix. She loves this ball because she gets to push it around and it drops treats. I have not had the problems that others have posted about. Some treats fall out but not a giant amount at once. The only problem I have seen is that sometimes my dog will want to pick it up and her bottom jaw has gotten stuck in it. So warning, if u have a bigger dog watch them with this incase they get their jaw stuck in it too. Other than that have had no problem with it. Her eyes lite up every time I pull it out lol</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 8 year old and 3 month old dog love it.  They were fighting over who was playing with it!  This is great for the puppy to keep her mind busy and learn new things.   I am going to have to buy another one plus a lot of treats to put inside it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I am so disappointed with this toy. My 2 great dane pups loved this toy. However, it broke within a week of getting it. I am not even sure how it broke. The blue tube inside that the treat can come out of broke off. The dogs could not even get to it so not sure how it manged to break. But once it was broken it does not even work as a ball to chase because the blue part is what holds it together. I would love to try another one but not willing to spend any more money on something that lasted a week.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My staffy mix is very smart and loves puzzle toys, but tends to destroy them quickly. This treat ball has held up surprisingly well. It’s covered in teeth marks but still intact after a week. It’s nice to find a toy for him that will last longer than a single use. My only complaint is that the holes the treats come out of may be a little big for most training treats. I’ve found that for me the treats that work best are Merrick Power Bites and Bones &amp; Chews Freeze-dried treats which are both a little bigger than most training treats.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/jw-pet-rockin-treat-ball/dp/40247,treat toys & dispensers,interactive toys

I put a few Cheerios in the bottom so the kibble doesn’t spill out while I’m filling it and I top it off with cream cheese, pumpkin, or some other yummy topper.

I recently found that I can stick a thin 6 in. bully stick in the small opening and it held securely</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our medium-size pup loves this toy. We use it as a slow-feeder to help ease separation anxiety -- throw about 1/4 cup of her food in and let her have at it. Definitely helps, and she loves chewing it even after she's got all the food out. We also place half-bones in there for a challenging treat. Never had issues with food being too small; you're supposed to load the food/treats in from the bottom, not the tiny top hole. Larger treats do occasionally get stuck, but this happens with every treat dispensing toy we've got. Needle nose pliers do the trick.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pup is an extreme chewer and this he hasn’t been able to rip apart! The material is similar to Kong. It’s a hard rubber that he hasn’t ripped but soft enough for his teeth to make indents.

Its soft but very strong rubber (same material as a kong toy). However, he will only play with it when I put kibble inside- once he gets it out, he loses interest in the toy. The toy is also pretty large- good for bigger dogs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My puppy finds this one a bit more challenging than some of the other kinds of dispenser toys we have. He likes it, I mainly use it as a slow feeder toy to get him to not scarf all of his food at once. It works.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This flying saucer is very cute! It has a large enough opening that I can put treats and kibble in it. Both of my dachshunds are enjoying these. However, they are pretty heavy for my dachshunds to pick up.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My one-year old pitbull pup loved this toy as soon as I gave it to her! She started playing with it and kicking it around before I even put any treats inside. It's definitely a fun addition to the toy box. I've even frozen it with some treats and peanut butter inside, similar to a Kong, and it is just as effective at keeping my pup occupied!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The product is a hard rubber so nice for a chew toy, but the hole makes or very hard to get treats out of.  My dog pushed around for about 15 min and still nothing.  I even had to squeeze it and shake hard and barely got a treat out.  I would recommend a different treat dispenser.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I wasn't sure he'd take to it, but I wanted my younger doggo to have a treat toy he would stay busy with. Well, it took a few minutes of coaxing and examples, but he's stuck on it now.

One is a power chewer.  I find the toy part is very tough and holds up well to a power chewer.  The down side is the treat ball that comes with the toy.  It just gets sticky and gross as the dogs lick at it.  At one point, my power chewer was able to pop it out and started to eat it outright.  I caught it and was able to take it away.  She popped it out multiple times, finally I flipped it around and inserted it backwards . That made it harder for her to remove.  Definitely supervise your dogs at all times with this toy.  I had purchased a pack of treat refills, but  I don’t think i will use any time soon.  The actual toy is good quality, so </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">While the treat inside the toy may not have been everlasting, the toy itself has zero damage against our 1.5 yr old Aussie Shepard mix. She’s a big chewer and usually takes minutes to devour her chew treats/give damage to toys but this one frustrates her and makes her work for it which is great. The disc treats seem a little easier for her to get out, still frustrating and take time, but overall less time than the ball treats that the toy comes with that they also sell. For our pup it was easily a 30 min-hour ordeal depending on the treat. And the toy as I said has zero damage so far with multiple plays. Even after we ran out of treats she’s still chewing on it and enjoying playing with just </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was so excited to get this ""everlasting treat"", hoping I could use it to occupy my 'big boy"" while my kids &amp; I eat. I was expecting it to be a solid ball of treat in the hard rubber holder. It ended up being a semi-flat disc of treat that my dog was able to devour in 10 minutes. The outside holder is definitely strong enough to survive my dog's powerful bite but the treat itself was disappointing. I thought I'd be able to use it while we ate, take it back and give it to him again and again as a training device until my dog learned to not beg and drool everywhere when we eat. The fact that the treat only lasted 10 minutes before he had it out of the holder and completely gone was frustrating</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Josiah pretty much begs for this toy.

Yes it looks like maybe a little toy, and it is but this rubber ring especially with the Starmark treats inside is his always go to.

I was confused on the size so I ordered both a small and a medium. His first was a small and I was shocked at how big the medium is. I’ll give the medium to a larger dog. My fault for not measuring his old toy. Here’s what I (and my dog) love about this ball: It’s a strong soft substance that my dog hasn’t been able to chew through.

I tried small kibbles of dry food and larger training treat, both work great. The greenie dental treat however is too challenging and he gave up.

I especially like that you can use a variety of rewards: kibble, bigger treats, even peanut butter or something lickable.

Our GSP loves the sporadic movement the toy makes as she bats it around the house. We love the mental stimulation it proves and the reward base system. I love that it is dishwasher safe. 

We fill our toy with kibble and small dog treats and love that you can adjust the size to accommodate different rewards. 100% recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We love this toy - it moves erratically so it keeps our dogs on their feet. The material is tough but not so hard as to hurt their teeth (it's already covered in teeth marks but no tears). We love that the difficulty is adjustable and that it can be easily cleaned. 

We bought a medium and our two 50lbs dogs love it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Both of my dogs like this toy, but I like it more! It's easy-to-clean, and I love that it's adjustable. It took one of my pups awhile to get the hang of the toy, while the other mastered it quickly. Luckily I can change the tightness to make it easier or harder depending on the pup.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got the biggest one for my xtra large GSD. It was his very favorite. (5+ stars)  He got very good at opening it no matter how tight I twisted it.  I had to start hiding it for him to find to extend the fun.   I got the small one for my toy fox terrier-mix.  I had to throw it away because she chewed right through it almost immediately.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">One of my dogs very much understands the concept of twist to open, so that limits a number of toys we can use for her. Otherwise, it's a good toy, hard to keep a full cup of kibble in, but I like you can mix kibble and something like peanut butter.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Do not like this, neither did my pup.

Made of sturdy material (rubber?) similar to a Kong. Excellent for bored dog in colder weather. She’s not a big chewer, but plays for quite a while when it’s filled with tiny dog biscuits.

She wasn't a huge fan. She sniffed it and walked away. I left it there though, thinking maybe she would show some interest in it eventually. Well a couple days later, I hear tons of noise and clanking upstairs. I come upstairs to see her playing with this toy trying with all her might to get those treats out! She ended up getting them all out eventually. Today, it's too hot for her to play outside but I want her to get some exercise so I put treats in this thing and gave it to her. She immediately went to work on it and hasn't left it alone since I gave it to her! She loves this toy. It's really loud and kind of annoying</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The bottle is very thick &amp; heavy, which is great until the big dog (60+ lbs) decides to fling it around indoors using the rope. She really loves this toy, so we’ve relegated it to outside use, for safety purposes. After a month, She hasn’t figured out how she can make the treats come out, which is pretty impressive - she usually figures out Treat-dispensers within a few days. She likes this mainly for throwing. This is a pretty heavy-duty Toy, and will last for a long time. 

The smaller dog (25 lbs) couldn’t care less about this toy. I think It’s just too heavy to interest her. She doesn’t want toys for more than fetch. The only reason she picks up any other toys is to annoy the big dog. So,</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 7 month old corgi chewed through the rope his second time ever using it. The first time he wasn’t able to get any treats without my help and it was frustrating for him. The second time I didn’t pay much attention to him while he was playing with it until it was too late. The one good thing I will say about it is the plastic didn’t crack even though he was throwing and slamming it on hardwood floors. I’m hoping I can use a rope from another toy as a replacement but we’ll see.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Neither of my poodles liked this great dispensing toy. It is too heavy and bulky for them to drag around and get treats out. I tried showing them several times to pull the rope but neither could do it. Other busy body toys I’ve gotten they like including the waggle and disc toy ad well as JW treat pods. I don’t recommend this for small dogs, one is 10 pounds the other is 20. :(</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Fur baby enjoyed this toy for a short time, as she lost interest. She wanted me to shake the food &amp; treats out of it. That might be part of the reason she lost interest, as I would help her. Spoiled dog. This is a good toy &amp; will keep them entertained.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">A previous dog enjoyed this toy so I got one for my 8 month old puppy.  He hasn't figured out to pull the rope but tips the bottle up so that kibble comes out. Love when he barks at it in frustration when the bottle is empty!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Wow! My labrabull puppy, Toby, just loves this thing! He’s a larger dog breed, and so we went with the larger sized bottle toy. 

 Toby likes to chew, and he’s got powerful pittie jaws, but he’s got zero prey drive and a mega mondo food drive. 

 If you too are the owner of an incredibly smart, reasonably able-jawed pooch like Toby, whose every thought during the day is when their next meal is coming, this is the toy for you! 

 Toby knows the names of his toys, and when I tell him he’s going to have supper in his bottle toy, his eyes just light up. He loves it!

 I can see why with dogs who are larger though, especially those who haven’t yet learned bite inhibition, it could be a bit of a problem</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We had the previous version of this for 10 years. The rope part used to be rubber like the knobby piece at top. Last week it started to crack and looked like it was going to break. So I ordered the new version. It was delivered today and within 10 minutes the rope was broken, making the toy useless. The rope version really didn't look like it was going to work very well because the knot didn't have enough weight to it to really pull out the treats - we used cheerios. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. This was our pup's favorite nightly treat.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a reliable toy that has been enjoyed by my dog for many years - and held up through all of it! Truth be told, I didn't realize the bottom unscrewed so I was just stuffing small training treats in through the top - my dog loves this, though. Always a challenge, and (she's a very smart dog) keeps her busy for a good, long while. Just make sure you don't have anything delicate below knee-height that it can be swung into! :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">New cavalier King Charles loves the idea but has not yet figured it out.

I was looking to add some variety to our collection, and liked that the Tricky Treat Ball wasn't so clunky or hard (noisy) like some of the other balls and wobblers. Unfortunately, most of the treats got stuck outside the dispensing tube, making it an incredibly frustrating toy for both me and my dogs. It's nearly impossible to clean the inside and it didn't stand up to regular wear and tear. After one session, it had gouges and scrapes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is not intended for heavy chewers but for dogs that need puzzles to challenge their mind. My shepherd/retriever mix needs fun challenges. Her activity level is higher than my other dog so I’m always looking for “puzzle toys”. I put about 10 Zukes mini training treats inside and it keeps her entertained while I eat breakfast. I keep it up out of her reach during the day so she knows it’s not for chewing up. She has other toys for chewing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog loved this toy as soon as we gave it to him, but he didn’t understand the concept of rolling/playing with it to get the treats out. He tried to chew through it to get the treats, and within 10 minutes he had chewed pieces out of it. We took it away for fear he’d swallow the pieces, and he’s still sniffing around the house to find it. It’s a bummer it’s not a tougher material.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is indeed tricky... There is one small hole where the treats fall out, what makes it particularly challenging is that the lip of the hole continues for about an inch and traps all the treats inside making it really difficult to actually get them out. Gizmo tries it for a little while and then gets frustrated and looks at me for help. I can't get the treats out either. Patience is not our virtue. Now we just spread gooey treats (like peanut butter) in the little craters on the surface of the ball instead. Way more fun and less frustration.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought a bunch of toys a couple weeks ago to give out slowly to my dogs. I gave this to my 15lb terrier mix with her breakfast food in it while I took a shower. Just in the 10 minutes I was in the shower she was able to chew through the side. Definitely do not recommend to any dogs that might be destructive. Unfortunately this was a total waste of money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this because Bailey is incredibly intelligent and loves the treat dispensing toys. I wanted something that didn't make the noise that hard plastic makes as she lifts it up and drops it on the floor.  Unfortunately, in less than ten minutes she chewed a hole in it. Chewy customer service was great when I called about it, but they replaced it with another one, which I can't use.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this after I was dog sitting and my client had this same exact toy for their pitbull. I bought it for my heeler and both balls have lasted a long time and are sturdy. I bough this months ago and it looks just as good as it did the day I got it. My only complaint is that the treats seem to come out too easy so I wish the hole was a little smaller but I will try using bigger treats and see if that helps.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a 60 lb pup who loves to play fetch, and is a power chewer. Have tried many toys and balls which ended up torn and trashed, but this one lasts! And it doubles up as a slow feeder (we trimmed the inside lip so treats come out a little easier; without doing that it was really difficult for even kibble to fall out). We got multiple so that should the day come where our current ball finally gets demolished, we have backups.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this because my dog needed something that would challenge her to get treats better than her Kong. Unfortunately the treats fall out easily just like the Kong. She never chews on her Kong but pretty much obliterates everything else including this Omega Paw treat ball. Lasted only minutes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a fun toy that I feed my dog a meal of kibble out of.  It is fun for him as it it rolls well and it is challenging as there hole has a large internal piece that catches the food so it doesn't just fall out easily it takes some rolling and sometimes shaking.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/omega-paw-tricky-treat-ball-dog-toy/dp/51233,treat toys & dispensers,interactive toys

For even more of a challenge, I fill the bottom of each pocket with Kong Easy Treat (the skinny nozzle is useful for getting in there) and stick some begging strips/liver in it, then freeze. This will distract my dog for almost 2 hours.

The only con of this toy is that usually my dog can only get 90% of the food out. My dog plays with it by sticking her tongue in it, which ends up pushing some food to the bottom. But it’s not a big deal</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Luna our 30lb. Aussie-Doxie mix really likes this toy. I will check back in on durability since we've only had it a few hours. She's a hardcore chewer and this toy doesn't have a single scar yet after 2 hours of playtime.

You can push the treats in further for harder difficulty or at the edge for an easier play session. We didn't buy the specialty treats, we just used what we had in the cabinet. I would recommend watching your pet to make sure it doesn't get too frustrating if they can't reach any of the treats!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Both of our Dals love the pickle! I'll be purchasing a second one since I only bought one at first to see how they would react to it. It has (3) perfect sized pockets and you can fit little kibbles of dog food or really any treat in them. The pockets are shallow so it's not too difficult for the dogs to get their treats out but still has the perfect balance of them spending time hunting for them and they never wind up getting frustrated. Great interactive toy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ""pickle"" is one of my dog's favorite toys.  We bought this for him when he was a puppy and after several years we needed a replacement.  There are several types of treats that fit in the pockets and he enjoys the challenge.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have had our pickle pocket for over 4 years. My dog absolutely loves it. Knows treats go in there and always brings it to us to fill, carries it around the house. I think it's hilarious that he has come to learn the word pickle.

I think the issue is that the Horseshoe has two walls that surround the treats and my GSD can’t easily get to it since her snout is too big.

Due to that he's been getting ahold of things he shouldn't and I feel a lot of it is out of boredom and being new to the home. Since this toy has showed up he has not lost interest. He is none stop with it and seems to be very happy with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’m disappointed for sure.. she had the little rings gone in 5 minutes, definitely not getting this again... didn’t work for my dog</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This seems fairly well constructed and I think it might work for a small dog, which is why I gave it 3 stars.  But our 70-lb retriever isn't interested.  He LOVES other Starmark treats and their large puzzles, so I think the only problem here is the size.  Although it is actually a pretty large toy overall, the inside slotted area is so narrow that he can't get either his nose or his paws in there to manipulate the treats, which don't fall out on their own.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 5 month GSD pup had the treats 10 minutes in.

It was very difficult to get the pods apart to be able to sneak a treat into them. I placed some soft treats in two of the pods and let him have at it. He wasn't able to get them out, instead they turned into a mushed mess all around the pods. When I tried to clean out said mushy mess, it was very difficult to get into the pod myself.

I ordered a replacement from Chewy and it's wonderful to have back in the house.

Our boys love this toy.  They are aggressive chewers, so the red tube around the ball didn't last too long, BUT the blue ball can still be used.  When the boys try to chew on the ball to break it open, it doesn't break, there are just some scratches left on the ball (they're larger golden retrievers, a dog with a bigger mouth like a mastiff could have more success in breaking it open).  I'm re-ordering, as the scratches on the outside of the ball have grown and hair is now starting to stick to it (but the ball is still intact and they still love it).</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a Border Collie and Beagle cross. I feed her with this style treat ball pretty often and she is quite skilled with these. So far this is my favorite because you can actually clean it! You'd be surprised how hard some of these suckers are to clean. 

The rubber bumper is made out of Kong material and is pretty durable as my dog does periodically just chew on it. I've seen larger unattended dogs somehow knock out the blue orb and do some damage to it. I recommend supervising your dog the first few times and show them how it works. The rubber ring makes it easy for dogs to pick up the toy and move it where they have more space.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">...the other loves.

I purchased one before I made an order of three just to be sure they liked playing with them. My last order, two came as described and have given my dogs excellent stimulation, but one of the three cane fused together, so I can’t open it to put treats in easily. I’ve been using extremely small treats and stuffing them into the holes at the top and bottom for my dogs to use. This would be five stars if they had properly cut the ball in half, but you</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The pros: toy is light weight so it is safe for small dogs, more quiet than most toy feeders, holds an entire meal for my 8Lbs dog, easy for me to screw open and close, &amp; keeps my dog from eating too quickly.
The cons: the description of the toy claims that it is adjustable and I guess it is...technically speaking but I was disappointed to learn that by adjustable they meant you could cut the prongs down to make the kibble fall out easier. However, there is no going back once you cut the prongs so you can’t make the toy harder if they get better at using it. One thing I have figured out is that I can put different sizes and shapes of kibble in the toy and that has a big impact on how long it </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this for my great dane/mastiff mix hoping it'd teach him to play with toys and slow down meal time. The toy is very large, and can hold almost all of his food. However, it is made out of a hard plastic that ""super chewers"" will very quickly crack. The attached photo is after about 15 mins. The top opening is already broken, and there were several little bits of plastic scattered in my dog's food and on the floor.  

This toy might be ok if your dog isn't a chewer, or if your dog has had something similar before and knows to roll the toy to get the treat out instead of chew on it. Otherwise I would not recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This could be just the one we relieved, but the ""locking"" mechanism on our busy buddy isn't that strong. The first time we gave this to our puppy she was having a great time trying to get kibble out, but after a few good paws at it the two sides turned in opposite directions and it started to open! This gave her free reign to eat all of the kibble out as if it was in a bowl. (This was done by our 15 week old puppy after cutting back the rubber on the inside so it wasn't too difficult to get the kibble to fall out.)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I'd high hopes because I needed a treat dispenser for a smart dog and it seemed like this might do the trick.  It dispenses after effort, no complaints there, and I do like that I can determine the size of the opening/difficulty.
What I disliked and what has resulted in it being pitched less than an hour out of the box is that firstly, they chose to put stickers on the container - not shown in the images, which my dog promptly began eating off and I had to spend some time scrubbing the paper and gummy residue off so she wouldn't ingest it.  (And really, why put stickers on a dog toy - they don't care what fun the dogs in the images are having!)
But moreso, the plastic ribbing on the outside</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I like that the treats dispense with some required effort and it's a good toy for one of our dogs.  The other one figured out how to open it the first time playing with it (his a bit more curious and determined than the other one).  Probably a good choice for many dogs, but not for both of mine.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves this toy and I love that I can give her entertaining toy.  I think it would be a great item to use to slow your dog down if they eat too fast.  The bowl is so big I put her meals in her and she loves it! The only downside to this toy is it is VERY loud on hard wood floors when she plays with it. haha</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves this toy and loves to play with it. It keeps her really busy and so far has stood up to her throw, hitting and chewing on it.  It is great when I need to keep her busy.  Small treats come out easy so really need medium size kibble or treats to make it a challenge.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our large dog was needing something like this.  I loved how much kibble it could hold.  Used 3vtimes, and 2 of 3 he is able to twist it completely open.  Defeating the whole purpose.  Disappointed that it was not able to manage its taa k.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Would be great for dogs who respect toys, but you can ONLY put SMALL kibbles or teensy treats in it.  I bought this as a donation to a coonhound in need of a home.  The treats I put in were just a hair too big, so she went crazy and pulled all the purple trim off and chewed it up really good in the first 30 min I gave it to her.  So I tried only her small kibbles which worked better, but she still got the egg apart.  It was ruined in only a few hours!  Kind of disappointed that I wasted my money on this.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/busy-buddy-kibble-nibble-treat/dp/48818,treat toys & dispensers,interactive toys

Because of its shape it doesn't ""roll"" evenly, which adds to the challenge of getting treats out. It's flexible enough to put slightly larger treats in (ex. milkbones) but tough enough to withstand chewing (so far).

I highly recommend this product!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Very durable.

It does have a bit of a strong rubber smell at first similar to the Kong, but it seems to have gone away after washing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog likes this treat toy.  He has a Kong but needed an extra treat dispenser toy. He likes to play with it as well.  Great price!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I stuck one large treat in here and it kept my cattle dog/ collie mix occupied for over 30 minutes, which is AMAZING.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I love that this is shaped like a football and my dog loves when it is stuffed with peanut butter. -1 star for a strong rubber tire smell that hasn’t gone away after multiple rounds of going through the top-shelf of the dishwasher.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have 2 dogs and bought 1 football.

I use Charlee Bear crunchy treats in the holes, they fit perfectly. My dog, a small dachshund, loves loves loves this toy. With a Charlee Bear treat in each hole, he has to bite down and break the treat to get it out of the hole. It’s a great way to occupy him a little bit and more fun for him than if I just gave him the treats. It can be extremely difficult to find treat toys for small dogs, so I was thrilled to find this one. I’ve not had any trouble with him damaging it or chewing it up. Once he’s done getting all the treats out </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My PuPpEr got her first one a few months ago . I use it when i leave for work fill it with treats and freeze it to eliminate anxiety Nd it works well.   But does get fatigued from use.  However I do recommend it .

Can find something similar design that lasts longer ,  I stuff it with her cookie treats and peanut butter and freeze them and it occupies her time nicely she Calms down .. and chills out</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">All 3 of my dogs loved these.. Stuck canned dog food in it and froze it.. They worked at it for over a half hour having fun. So many different things that you can use to put in them and freeze, canned food, dehydrated food, yogurt, cottage cheese, PB. I also cut baby carrots and stuck them in there as well... Easy to clean, just have a bowl of hot water with dawn dish soap and let them soak in that for a few days, then rinse..</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought one of these for Daisy when she was a pup (she’s 4 now) and replaced it about 6 months ago with a new one after the old one had been “loved” too much. Every morning I fill it with 4 small Bits treats, at least 4 baby carrots and sugar snap peas in season. Then the carrots get a dollop of Kong StuffN peanut butter squeeze treat. Daisy LOVES it and now Little Bear (12 weeks) does too (he has his own)! I can squeeze peanut butter in the crevices too, for another way to treat/occupy. I highly recommend. As I mentioned, Daisy’s first one lasted over 3 years before I could see teeth marks.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My standard goldendoodle puppy has a lot of anxiety being left in his crate.  I tried traditional frozen kongs, blankets, a snuggle puppy... nothing seemed to work!

That's what I've been using in the Qwizl as a treat.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got one of these for my two dogs, one is very particular about her chew toys, and I need to order another immediately. They both love it and have been reluctantly sharing it since I unboxed it. It’s the perfect fit for the Mother Hubbard small biscuits I have, and it took my more industrious dog over an hour to finish the whole treat.

He was attracted to it even before I added a treat. He's only 14lbs. and his toy is fairly heavy, but he loves to toss it and play with it all by himself.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I love this toy! Bought a small one for my 10lb dog. You can put a bully stick in it through the smaller holes on the end and it keeps my dog from destroying a bully stick in 3 min. And it's safer because it is very hard for her to pull it out of the little hole. You can also put things like greenies in the slit to make them last longer as well. My dog is a power chewer but our qwizl is still in perfect condition after 6 month of use.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is a total favorite for our adorable pitbull foster girl.  It has really helped us work through some separation anxiety issues by keeping her amused instead of bored and distressed.  We use dental sticks as an affordable and multi-purpose filler.  Also, it's tough enough to hold up to half a year of heavy use by a strong jaw.  This is super important because for safety reasons, we wouldn't want to leave any dog alone with a toy that easily breaks into pieces that could be swallowed. Ours has just started to fall apart, so we are ordering a new one. Price is a great value for 6 months of fun.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is great for putting the small ends of bully sticks in, so my dogs can chew more of it without worrying if they might swallow them. Otherwise I don't think my dogs would have any interest in this toy and I have other toys that work better for treat dispensing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My great dane puppy absolutely loves the West Paw products. We have their z tug toy and she enjoyed it so much that we went with the Qwuzl toy this time around. I stuff it with a 6in bully stick and she is entertained for LITERALLY hours. Such a great toy. She loves to rub her teeth on these products - something about the texture. Either way they're great. A little on the pricy side but worth it for the quality.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a great toy, we put a monster Bully Stick in it, and our dog plays with it a lot. Thanks, Qwizl, we own two!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought 2 West Paw toys for our 10 year old medium heavy chewer. This one &amp; the more expensive Zoggoflex Toppl.

My Pittie Enzo chews through EVERYTHING. We bought this because it seemed to be made of some pretty rugged plastic. It kind of wasnt a big hit until we stuffed an antler in the bottom (or top). My Enzo used his paws like hands and manages to hold everything like a person. Antlers are about the only thing that lasts around here but he has a hard time holding onto them. This this has kept him busy &amp; happy forever! I have actually bought backups just incase they stop making it...</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">If your dog is a heavy chewer, they will chew this into pieces quickly. Once my dog got the treat out, she started chewing pieces of it off. It is not regular Kong material, it’s softer. A little disappointed. I was hoping for a toy that would keep her busy and also not shred.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves this toy. It is just difficult enough to challenge her when she gets bored but she is able to get all the treats out by herself (I use the Nutro Crunchy triangular shaped treats). She has learned to either bounce the toy or squeeze it with her teeth with it turned in just the right direction so one of the treats fall out. Just perfect to keep her entertained but not frustrated.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered two of these.  The blue one is soft enough that my little dog can bite it and open up the holes enough for kibbles to come out.  The pink one is extremely tough.  So tough that my Border Collie x Golden Retriever can't bite down on it enough, and it took me a hard time to squeeze kibbles in, but it hurt.  I cut the pink one up a bit so they come out easier, but it was not easy to slide the edge of the scissors in there.  The pink one can rough up a finger and my BC x GR is a licker usually when trying to get treats/kibbles out of toys like this, so no doubt she hurt her tongue trying to fit it though.  ~*~ I haven't bought more than these two, so can't say for sure if all pink ones </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 6 month old 5 pound puppy looooooves this toy. I fill it with her favorite treats and she plays hours.she chews and tosses it all over the place. She comes and goes to and from the toy. Whenever she sees it after leaving it she pounces. It’s pure entertainment for me as well. I love Kong!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Kong toys are the best.  My Labradoodle is crazy about her wobbler and several other treat toys from the brand.  Sadly this item doesn't make the strength cut.  Tally chewed into it within an hour of arrival.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is not an aggressive chewer. She enjoys the treat enticement, and the long neck to chew on. It holds up very well to her play.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have the Mike toy that goes along with this one.  It's held up GREAT, so we wanted to add this one for a little challenge.  Well, as many of the other reviews suggest (as well as the description from Kong, to be fair) this is NOT a good addition if you have an aggressive chewer, as it WILL get destroyed within minutes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog chewed off small pieces of this toy the first time we used it while she attempted to get the treat out. Luckily I was watching and took the toy away before she swallowed a small piece of rubber, but was very disappointed that we got no use out of this. Fun idea, bad execution.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves this toy, and spends hours at a time getting the dog treats out that I put inside.

I have another one that's at least 4 years old and still going!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’m very pleased with the quality of this toy! It’s very similar to Kong but it almost feels more sturdy. I put my dogs kibble in his small sized kong and it doesn’t hold very much, so I ordered this in a medium. It’s bigger then I expected but that’s ok! I can fit his full breakfast serving of food in here and I can also do pieces of carrot sticks or other treats as a boredom buster. I haven’t tried any of the stuff and free recipes but I may order some of the small sizes and do that.

Hands down. Purchase it for the love of God. Not only does my (70 lb) boy pick it up for frequent playing, but it has given me absolute peace of mind with regard to his eating habits. Prior to being diagnosed with pancreatitis, my boy would get an occasional bout of moodiness and refuse to eat, even GUARD his food; I mean: hackles and snapping, due to his pain, the baby. Now if we're traveling or off schedule and I sense he's not inclined to eat - I just put his (dry) food in the toy - and he does not mind me being in the same room!! Crisis averted. Hospital bills averted! Love love love!! This is my second purchase, NOT because the one of three years</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this toy for my 78 pound boxer/pitbull mix 2 years ago and it is still going strong!! She is tough on her toys and can easily ruin “indestructible” toys in no time. This one is still looking brand new after 2 years of almost daily play! There’s 3 separate treat compartments and the unusual shape of the toy makes it bounce all over the place in an unpredictable way.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I had a smaller one for my lab/pit mix and decided to upgrade.  She loves this one more than the last and is always bringing it to me to be refilled.  I prefer the larger one as it allows for more variations in treat sizes.  It's the perfect size for a medium-size dog.  Enjoy pups- From Dawn the dog!  Yes, dogs can type!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The rugger smell of this is HORRID.  I tried handwashing it and running it through the dishwasher, but all it did was make the other dishes in my dishwasher smell like the rubber.  Had to rewash other dishes, this is either returned or trashed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The 'New' polyethylene odor has stopped me from giving to my dog.  I bought 3 similar dog treat toys at the same time.  I have had one of these treat dispensers for years.  My hope is that the 3 new dispensers will 'air out' and benefit from dishwashing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I really like the concept of this toy as it keeps my 6 month old puppy very busy and also serves as a way for him to get a snack, I fill it with kibble and treats. What I don’t like is that it is heavily scented/perfumed. It smells like vanilla and is so strong that my entire living room smells like it. I washed it with warm soapy water and it continues to give off a strong odor. While the odor isn’t unpleasant, it worries me that my pup is investing chemicals.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog absolutely loves this toy. Has had it for a couple of days, and so far, it hasn't been destroyed. I bought the medium size and the small. Small works perfectly for my medium sized Basenji (30lbs). Finally, I found something that will last me awhile.  If it does get destroyed (eventually), I'll buy another. It's hard to find toys that hold her attention for very long.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I think this treat will be a bit better for my dog when the weather is warmer and I can make it a frozen treat for him. The prongs inside of it make it hard to know at all when a treat will come out (i have cut them shorter). The toy mainly needs to be bounced and thrown for a treat to come out which my dog isn't all that fond of (not much a fetch player) but I will try more with it when it's nicer out and we can use it outside. I'd recommend it more for dogs who are inclined to playing fetch like that but for those more fond of pushing a toy around or chewing/licking there are different toys more geared for that.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Great design and challenging puzzle. It has a very rubber-y smell so Shiny has not played with it too much. But we will leave it out to air &amp; I have no doubt it will be brought to me to stuff every morning!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves this! Keeps him busy for a long time; he loves it!! Still looking for the perfect treats to use in it, he actually brought to me for help because he couldn’t get some treats out!!</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/busy-buddy-barnacle-treat-dispenser/dp/48173,treat toys & dispensers,interactive toys

We dont use the treat dispenser but it does give the duck more body so he inst turn to shreds</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So my dogs are BOTH big chewers and LOVE to destroy toys. This one has held up to 5+ hours of play. I hid treats inside and it took them 3 hours to get all of them out. Plus the squeaker has still held up.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">She loves shaking it by the crinkly wings. It is pretty hard for her to get the treat out of the belly, but she is a small dog. The squeaker doesn't squeak as well as I would like, but overall it's a great toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our Giant Schnauzer got 2 treats out of it &amp; then the rubber disintegrated. He’s not a big chewer either. May be good for little dogs but not big ones. Oh well.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">With a Lab and Pom both my dogs couldn’t get the treats out (and they were small treats) and tore the toy into pieces!!! Maybe just my dogs but after the 2nd day we had to throw them away!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It took her a while to get the treats out, which is great for us - she can entertain herself while we work for a bit.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves this duck. I think he enjoys the crinkley wings and different textures. The treat dispensing belly was a great idea, but the rubbery plastic was no match for him. The second time we gave it to him he chewed up the ducks belly, making that aspect of the toy useless. I hope to find a version of this toy with a much more durable material for the treat dispensing part.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 5 month old pointer/hound went nuts as soon as I unboxed it. She was flinging it high in the air and chasing it well before I could even put in treats. She had the crinkle wings ripped and dangling within 5 minutes. She’s usually quite gentle with her stuffies so I guess the crinkle was what triggered it. I might just stitch it up and let her keep it as she still adores it and begs us to throw it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Not a chewer, but mischevious if she doesn't have an activity to stay busy.  Love this! a staple.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought this for our 6 month old Rotweiler mix puppy and he has the belly ripped up and tore out in a matter of minutes followed by stuffing and squeaker moments later.

Its very durable for our 78 lb husky mix aggressive chewer. Very few toys can stand up to her powerful chewing. We purchased the largest one. We are using it as a toothbrush chew toy for her. She’s on a special diet so she can’t have the treats that are made for it. We just use her doggy toothpaste on the bristles and give it to her for 10-15 minutes every day. She loves it. It does a really good job cleaning her teeth. There are only a few areas that need a little more work on my part with a finger brush.I love that it all comes apart for easy cleaning too.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog tried this chew toy and lost interest pretty quickly. He is 35 pounds, and the medium I purchased is too large for him. It is also very hard plastic which he doesn't seem to like. The attached treats do not keep his attention. I have a friend whose dog loves his bristle bone, (I gave it extra stars for that) so it's a matter of individual taste, I guess. Not for me and my dog, though.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 55lb Aussie's mouth is not big enough to bite into the center brush area.  He can however, easily pull the treat rings out of brislte bone and eat them seperately and quickly.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this for my 73lb pup (almost a year old) who loves to chew. At first, I gave it to him with the treats. He figured it out and got the treats off relatively quickly (but he's pretty smart if I do say so myself). He loves the toy even without the treat, it is his new favorite. The only downside is that the pieces of ""bone"" that stick out dont hold up well. We have had this for about 1 week and one of the ""ears"" is gone. But he is so excited, and it keeps him stimulated and keeps his teeth clean. Plus, putting the treats in is an added bonus here and there. Whenever he destroys this I will absolutely be getting another! All around win</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is the BEST!!!!! I can not recommend enough. It’s a great size, incredibly durable, AND you can add on new treat rings to keep your pup interested. My dog would not put it down, i think he actually spent over 3/4 hours straight chewing on it the day we received it. It is so so so worth the money. The treat rings are tough to get off, and my pups LOVE the scent/taste of them as well. The best toy ever. I can’t recommend enough</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the second Bristle Bone Dog Toy for our dog. He loves it. I use the rawhide discs with it as well as peanut butter or ‘spray cheese’....cheese in a can..  I am amazed at how much better his teeth look.  He was able to get the end off and chewed the threads on the post. That made it a little difficult to screw it back together.  He has used it so much that I noticed some missing chunks of bristles so I bought a replacement bristle bone toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dogs love these! We get the raw hides that go with them and it keeps them busy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">No one in my house likes the very strong odor of this toy, including my two Goldens.  I ordered one toy for each of them and neither of my dogs will get near it, even with the little rawhide circles installed.  I might have made a different decision about buying them, if the ""scented"" aspect was in the website description.  

Aside from that, it looks really sturdy and is dishwasher safe.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a lab mix and I've tried all kinds of things to keep his teeth tartar-free and thought this would do the trick - brushing while he's having fun! On his third session it ended up in pieces: he'd eaten the good bits and quite a bit of the bits that he ought not to have eaten, leaving the bone in pieces. I'd certainly recommend it for smaller dogs though, and for parental-controlled periods (which I was doing) only.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have both sizes of these toys now and our dogs love them.  Make sure to order the correct size of treats that go on.  They get chewed up, but you can still unscrew them and keep using them for a long time.

Overall, good product.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So thank you chewy for replacing the first one where the top treat part arrived broken. (Last photo). Unfortunately that part doesn’t last long anyway. My black pit mix is very food driven so will tear something apart for treats or food so she’s pictured with tearing the bottom of it.

This has 4 rubber fingers inside the the opening that make it more challenging to get the treats (the directions say you can trim those back if you like, but when you do, there is no going back.)  Also the squeaker is still squeaking.  It's not like a regular squeaky toy where she can pull out the squeaker and destroy it.
Definitely will order another if the time comes!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Dogs went crazy when given new chew toys.  Sadly they’ve been taken away. Toys are made in China.  I do not trust toys made in China for my pets. Very disappointing.

He loves squeak toys, I may order another so they can each have their own.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So it is a good concept. I ordered a medium and a large, one for each dog and the smaller medium I made the mistake of not chopping the treats in half so now the toy is full stuffed of treats that the poor little dog can’t get out and he’s getting very ticked. I tried cutting the prongs and thumping it and squeezing and I can’t even get them out. My mistake. The large size is difficult but after thumping they eventually come out. Had I chopped the treats into smaller pcs it could have been a fun toy. I’ll have to pitch the smaller one if he ever gets away from it. My bad. So just make sure not to put too large of treats in it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I trimmed the prongs like it stated to for easier access to the treats, but my pup still just doesn’t like the toy itself. It doesn’t have a lot of treat capacity and he doesn’t like to play with it. He has 3 treat dispensing toys and this is the only one he doesn’t like.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our ten month old Border Collie is now being called Destructo Pup.  All the soft toys with squeakers are put away.  Some should be thrown away, some repaired, some await until Katie has no more teeth.  She wants the squeakers out and she wants them out now!

It’s great for putting tiny treats in that fall out when they roll it around, but as far as putting a milk bone type treat in it, I don’t think it’s good for that because once they bite the end off that’s sticking out, the other 1/2 remains inside the ball and it’s quite difficult to get it out.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I just brought home my 8 week old German Shepherd and had the 3"" Jolly Ball waiting for him.

When the food pops out of the opening, it will scatter over 5 feet around the dish.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Golden Retriever loves to push things around with his nose. Works best with small amounts of kibble since the popping mechanism isn’t very strong. If you put to much food in it will not pop food out the top. To small for large breed meals but good for treats and enrichment activities.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Love this product!

If I do not push it around for my girl to get the treats, she simply gets them out with her tongue. An improvement to this would be a higher dome. One of the times my girl pawed the top, she hit it too hard, the popper broke. However, it was an easy fix, the popper has stayed together since. A plus to this toy is if the popper comes apart you do not need to trash the toy, simply open the toy and put the popper back together.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We put small kibble and it does not ""pop"" out anything.

But this Sol ball - wow! 

It's hollow and about an inch thick. It's squishy. And because of its larger size, it's not super easy for him to pick up. He has to work at grabbing it which keeps him more interested.

There is a light lip on the inside, however, and this prevents the food from falling out without being hard to fill. Getting the last few pieces requires some work! She can't just stick her tongue in it like some other toys we've tried. 1/4 cup of food takes her maybe 10 minutes.

If you have an extremely aggressive chewer, like my dogs, this is not the right toy for you. My lab got frustrated that she couldn't get the treats and immediately went on a mission to get inside any way she could. She literally shredded one side of this within about a 1/2 hour to 45 minutes. I was actually shocked at how quickly she had destroyed it when I thought she was just trying to figure it out and get at the treats. This was, yet another, fail for us and had to be thrown away the day I got it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Similar to other reviewers’ feedback, we turned away for a few minutes and when we looked back our pup had shredded open the hole in the top. Another 10 minutes and the toy would have looked like a cup.

Size medium bone.  Squeak didn’t work either.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I've stuggled to find toys for large dogs.

It is made to put a treat in and be interactive but the toy doesn't hold up long enough to be functional.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We got this toy for our Lab when he was a 4 month old puppy.  He played with it a bit, but has kind of left it alone for a while. He is now an 8 month old Lab and he found this toy and destroyed it in five minutes.  It also doesn't squeak any more.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Very strong bone for him to play with and chew on. He loves trying to get the treats out  it’s hard for him which is fine keeps him busy but than he finally gets them. He is a Shepherd, cattle dog and Doberman mix about 57 pounds</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog gets treats and food out of toys at lightening speed so I didn't have high hopes for this toy. It is great! It takes her a good while, sometimes it's a little too hard. Her kibble fits perfectly and doesn't fall out. We also put smaller treats in it. She broke the squeaker pretty immediately but that's half the fun. She also likes playing fetch with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this because it was inexpensive. It was smaller than I thought. It only held one treat. My pit bull got the treat out in 3 seconds and chewed the opening apart within a minute. The toy did not squeak for us.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs had this in pieces the first day.

He sniffs, licks, gnaws, and tosses it, and will stop doing almost anything if I tell him to go find it. Over time, he has been able to gnaw a few chunks off, but he's usually so interested in the treat inside that he just spits them out. He loves it so much, I'm planning to buy a few just in case they change the model or discontinue it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">That’s how long this was whole.

He likes toys he can rip apart best, but I can't afford to support that lifestyle. This bone is perfect for him.

I ordered this toy because it is advertised as tough, but it definitely is not. It only lasted two days because he got other toys for Christmas that he played with simultaneously. And I did not see any indication that it calmed him. Would not recommend this for anyone with moderate to tough chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">To all the other reviews who said the medium size is still fairly big, no. It is not. The squirrel is surprisingly small, really only big enough for a cocker spaniel at most. The barrel looking one is almost double in size though.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog mastered his last slow feeder, so I wanted to try something new. The inside triangles that keep the food from falling out were a little too much, so I cut a few of them back so it wasn't impossible for him. I put wet food in the large part of the barnacle toy and it took him like 45 minutes to get it all out. I'm not sure if it actually has a calming affect on him, but there was construction right outside our apartment all day and he seemed pretty chill about it, only barked a few times... maybe it did work. 
The toys are great for treats and dry kibble too, they seem to be quite challenging, but he loves chewing, nudging, licking, and moving the toys around to get all the snacks out.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a great toy to help to occupy my sweet Matilda's time.

He is a small, terrier mix (15 lbs) and he definitely has to pick the toy up and drop it to get the treats out. However, he does not have any trouble getting all the treats out of the toy, even with the inserts.

After 3 times playing the fabric around the edges and the ball were loose and coming off. Good toy for play but wish it was sturdier and the holder for treats was sewn better to prevent it from turning.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 12 year old pitbull likes this toy( he'll use it ) it doesn't seem like it's very well made I could see if a younger puppy got ahold of it it would not last long he's really gentle with his toys and doesn't really use his teeth much but does pick it up and throw it to get treats out of it, we have a lot of different activity treat toys that are better quality and that he likes more but put it in our rotation</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Got this for my 5 month old lab/coon hound mix to try and keep her busy but she destroyed the cloth part in less than an hour. She got the ball out of the center and plays with it some now but I will probably take that away from her too. Not worth the money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">First, you need to know we have two aggressive and strong chewers, a GD and a 50-pound TWC/beagle mix named Dutchess. Dutch did destroy this toy eventually, but it lasted much longer than most soft toys. She is both smart and stubborn and fairly quickly pulled the plastic center with its treats out of the cloth so it was easier for her to get out the treats. The cloth section was then used for tug of war with her sister. I believe it would be quite good for less aggressive chewers or smaller dogs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Received this for a valentine gift. My puppy of 3 months old, had it demolished in 10 minutes. It is not anywhere near as strong or durable as it states on here.  Really hope she didn’t swallow anything.  Very pore quality not worth the money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Well, I got this toy for my newest addition to our family since she is rough with her toys, I thought this would be perfect. Not. This toy was destroyed by my little baby within minutes after getting it. Would not recommend. I was going to get the small one since she is small, and changed it to medium if my bigger baby wanted to play with it. And the size of the medium could be considered small. Very disappointed. Wish I wouldn't have wasted my money on this.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 65 lb. girl whose goal is apparently to destroy any toy she gets. I thought “Extreme” meant it was for extreme play. It only took about 5 minutes for her to get the treat ball out of the thin canvas-like material, and then rip the trim off and chew a big hole in it. The ball is still a good toy I guess, but she prefers the bounce of a regular old tennis ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It is smaller than I thought it would be but my dogs love to throw this toy around to get treats.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It survived my dog who's nickname is Capt.

But this peanut butter stuff in a can makes him gassy, and he actually threw it up once when I put a little on top of his kibble. Anything in a can like this is unnatural and I wouldn’t ever buy this again for my beloved pup. It’s the same concept as “Squeazy Cheese” for kids. It’s fake and made with a ton of artificial crap. I should’ve known this before buying though just by looking at the ingredients. Ick</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog LOVES peanut butter, but we find that it gives him loose bowel movements the next day. It's also a pretty high calorie treat. I wanted to try this as a peanut butter alternative, and have been really happy with my purchase. It's easy to insert in his Kong, and is much easier to clean up than real peanut butter. It's easy to squeeze a little on to pills to entice my dog to take them. And, it smears much like peanut butter on the side of the tub when it's time for a bath. I'm looking forward to trying other flavors to see how my pup likes those.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’m sure it’s not very healthy, but when I put it on my dog’s kibble, she gobbles it! She was spayed this week and we had a hard time getting her to take the pain medicine and sedatives with those pill pockets that she actually loves the flavor of. Anyway, I decided to hide the pills in this and she licked the whole thing in seconds, pills included! I’ll be a life-long customer, I believe, even if just for special occasions.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was an amazing choice to give my 7 month old puppy. He loved it and kept him busy and he loved it the flavor. I got this with the kong and it was one of the best choices I made. It help kept him quiet while in his kennel while I was gone or busy! I would definitely recommend. The only complaint I have , it was kinda hard to clean once the stuff dried.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have given this to my dog in the past, and she seems to enjoy it until two days ago where I gave her a little extra to distract her while grooming her and this morning I find yellow feces. She doesn't seem to have any other negative symptoms, will be watching for the next few hours but as a pet parent it's alarming to see that. Won't be buying again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog has separation anxiety. We stuff a Kong toy with peanut butter when we leave him alone. This can makes it very easy to put the peanut butter in the toy and the dog seems to like it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Great way to get my 60lb. Goldendoodle to use her toothbrush/chew toy! The first time I put too much in as it is silent when it is being dispensed so just be aware. It really does only take a small amount to keep her busy for several minutes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought a can of peanut butter flavor for my puppy because I wanted to try it in her brand new Kong classic (she's already a pretty heavy chewer so I was afraid the puppy version would be too soft) and if you use the stuff like it says to the can should have at least last a decent time depending on how often you use the Kong with your dog. It's easy to use and she really liked it. It lost a star for price tho. It's a pretty small can and if you use the Kong a lot or don't read the directions and try to fill an entire Kong with it you'll end up spending a lot of money. If it was a little cheaper I'd definitely give it 5 stars.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The last order I got it was very runny and I had to throw it away..First time I got one that was runny..My Dog loved this but I didn't want to give it to him with it being so runny..Not sure if it was a bad batch..</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs love this treat and is much lower in calories than giving them real peanut butter.

The safety of the rubber container is excellent and seating the item os simple.  

My dog is a 45# pit, so she does work her teeth through some of the ridges before tearing it out and chewing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We use this to refill the Starmark Everlasting Treat Wheeler and my GSD loves this flavor.  As a helpful hint, if you need to wet the treat in order to get it into the toy, you also have to let it completely dry before giving it to your dog. The same way that it is hard to get the treat inside the toy when it is dry, is the same difficulty that the dog will have getting it out. Conversely, the same ease that you have getting the treat in the toy when it is wet, is the same ease your dog will have getting it out of the toy if it is wet.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I gave this to my 25 lb Goldendoodle puppy and she ate the whole thing under an hour. Not to mention, I also got the large size. She seemed to LOVE it, so that was a plus! I guess I am only just a tad disappointed with the “ever-lasting” claim, since it barely lasted an hour. I expected it to last at least like a couple days due to its claims. Oh well! What can you do! Like I said, she LOVED it, but just be weary it’s not really “ever-lasting”.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our little 10 lb. mini-poo mix is quite a chewer for a small dog. When we first gave these treats to her, it took her a while to get at the treat. We gave it to her in the small orange colored toy; but she actually chewed through that! Now, we give her the small size in the black wheel. She can now get to the two treats pretty fast. However, we started giving it to her strictly during our dinner time, and it keeps her so busy, she doesn’t have time to come to the table and beg. Heaven! I go through a pack a day, so I stock up on them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The flavor must be incredible; if he sees me filling his treat toy he patiently waits til it’s dry and just stares at it! After a few he figured out the trick to get them out, but it still keeps him busy for a little while. The best part is they don’t upset his sensitive stomach.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought these to go with the tire chew toy. The treat that was in the toy when we got it lasted a good while but the replacement one did not.  It popped out with in 5 minutes.  After managing to get it back from Cooper-no small feat-I put it away for the day.  After getting the edge barely wet, I reinserted the treat and then let it sit for several hours thinking maybe that was why it popped out so quickly the first time. NOPE, he had it out and devoured in less than 10 minutes. That was a waste.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Apparently, ""everlasting"" means five minutes in the case of these chews.

Do not recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">First I just bought the bento ball which already came with the treat inside, she had that out of the ball and gone in 5 mins but i went ahead and bought another pack she likes them but they don’t last as long as I’d expect but these ones lasted at least 20-30 mins</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought these for my girls bento balls and they just love them.  I have a two year old and a one year old and it keeps them busy and they don't eat my shoes, clothes or other things now.  Takes them a week or so to lick and chew it done.  Great product.  Will leave this and the no grain one on my Autoship.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 50lb lab mix loves these!! He will lay down and gnaw on it for hours if I need him to be distracted for a bit. I literally have to take it from him and if it's in his view he'll whine and beg for it. He loves these and I like that they're inserts so when he's done with one I just have to replace it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog loves the toy they fit into, he plays and chews on it even without the treats.  The only back draw to them is he removes the treat in under 5 minutes and eats it.  He is a 80lb German Shepard we tried putting the treat in both sides and hardly slowed him down.  So this is not a treat everyday because of the cost.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I don't write reviews at all! My puppy will not put this down. She is a 6 mos. Terrier mix and has been chewing on furniture and anything else she can get her hands on! Plays with this toy for hours!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Apparently very tasty! My tough chewer consumed immediately. Problem is, he then destroy toy dispenser!

Issue for us has been despite getting the correct size for the correct size Kong (the round pyramid one) she breaks them off and part gets stuck inside.  She gives up and then I spend several mins with a screwdriver trying to get it out.  Seems like Kong is making the width of these just slightly to large for the size toy it is intended for.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My aussie/collie puppy Misty loves the taste of these, but unfortunately she is too big for them now. I didn't realize I got the small ones, so they fall right into the Kong and frustrate her to get out. I end up fishing them out. That was all well and good 3 weeks ago, but now that she's doubled in size, I worry about them being too tiny and choking her. 
That all said, I will buy the bigger size for her.

They are much too small for it...apparently there is an even smaller one than this one we have, so be aware of sizing needs. I wanted something that would keep our pup occupied for a bit.  Our 12 week old pup loves them, but they’re gone in just a few minutes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a 12 week old golden retriever puppy and purchased the large puppy Kong and large ziggies.

Once the treat is gone he spends a few minutes sniffing the floor for any remnants he may have missed to make sure he got all of it! 

I like these treats better than other teething treats because they crumble instead of becoming sticky pieces that get stuck in his mouth. These do NOT make us worried that he will choke! Will definitely be purchasing more!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My older Havanese was not a fan of this kong and any kong treats.

Combine that with the packaging change from a box to plastic and most cookies arrive in a crumbled mess unusable for their intended purpose.

It's nice that I don't have to worry about her eating the toy itself. I personally haven't hadn't any issue with broken treats.

I paid a lot to just throw them away, but now you know and hopefully you choose wiser than I did. Also don’t get the accompanying toys that hold these treats. It’s a hard plastic which was much too tempting for our little guy. He chose to chew the sides of the bone rather than the gross treats!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was disappointed.

She HAS to have 3 rings placed on her orb nightly or she will bring the orb to the top of our wood stairs and roll it down, retrieve it and drop the orb again.  Once she has her fix she is ready for bed.  They are a quick little treat for her, not long lasting,  but she loves them!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These are tiny, although tasty to the pups, not worth the price.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We received the bone these go into from a relative because the American Bulldog did not like it; too frustrated w/ the bone.  Our GSD loves the bone and the rings.  The only negative is that they don't last long.  She has them out of the bone and gone in 10 min. or less.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I purchased these edible rings dog treats to insert in the applicable Starmark chew toy for my dog.  Gracie Allen does not find the edible rings interesting at all.

He’s a big chewer and as a rescue he suffers from past anxiety we’re trying to figure out. He has a stockpile of stuff and he will go in and out to keep himself occupied, but he absolutely loses his stuff when I pop the rings out of the package and put it into the little bone they offer as a vessel for the treats. 

My guy is smart and he has figured out the quick route to getting the treat out (he’s a hoss) but I’m happy with the product and he is happy with the product and that’s a small win in my home.

They are great with the Kong toy or by themselves.     But to change things up, we will try other biscuits that have more natural ingredients.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought these Stuff’N treats to go in the Kong I bought for our new puppy.

Definitely not buying these again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pup doesn't hate them, but she certainly doesn't love them. I put them in the hole once the Kong is stuffed with dry food layer and wet food layer. 
One frustrating thing about these is that they crumble and break rather easily when you stuff them in the Kong and sometimes when pup is playing - a larger piece will break off into the Kong and then becomes near impossible to get out - for human or for pup</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/kong-stuffn-puppy-snacks-dog-treats/dp/38987,treat dispenser refills,interactive toys

The barbell shaped toys end unscrew to hold a rawhide chew ring on each end.  Its a challenge for him to chew both of them off their secure screw on ends and he usually spends about 20 minutes or more on the project.  This is medium sized and durable (6 years!) toy and the rings are very hard to find at stores and pet shops.

The treats are from Taiwan... and I only buy U.S.-made.

The remaining treats will be going in the compost. Do better, Chewy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog love,love,loves these treats! She looks for them every day.

Not only is this great for filled holes in Kong toys, and similar narrow opening toys, but I’ve also used it to coat pills, and make a meal a little special!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I am so afraid of over the counter peanut butter treats and KONG MAKES THAT EASY NOW. This is real peanut butter and my dogs like it better than the can that I’ve used in the Kong treat. it’s about the same price and I use it for their meds and the only thing that’s hard is the way to open it. But even that isn’t that bad.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Even before we had a chance to try squeezing the peanut butter out of the tube a liquid version of it came pouring out onto the kitchen counter and floor.

Finnley (7.5lb chihuahua pup) enjoys when I squeeze small amount of this into the lines of the dental stick toy or in the ridges of the kong bone. It keeps him occupied for a very long time. Even after he gets the small amount out, I don't feel guilty adding a bit more to his toy. I'm sure this would be great to use to conceal medicine, or as a training treat, since it's very simple to control the amount you squeeze out. I've used this to seal a classic/puppy kong, but I think I would rather use some wet dog food for my ease. The tube needs you to use some pressure to squeeze out (a bit firmer than a tube of toothpaste). And, this variety needs no refridgeration</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pup LOVES peanut butter, but carrying around a jar or full Kong’s when traveling was not very convenient.

Actual peanut butter and they gobble it up. I use it to give pills and it works like a charm.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My poodle loves this flavour and I use is to cover his yucky medication.
He has a protein intolerance, so he is on a special protein altered diet (who’d have thought?) and pills EVERY day.  Easy to use.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/kong-stuffn-real-peanut-butter-treat/dp/44188,treat dispenser refills,interactive toys

The texture of these treats (which are actually TOO small to fit their own brand of dispenser ball) is 'eraser-esque', and the overwhelming smell of plastic turns my stomach and the dog's. Admittedly, she gave a few a try, but now tries to bury them in her blanket whenever they are offered.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Treats seem to be enjoyed by dogs but are too small to hand feed them.  I didn't realize that this type of treat is meant to be used in a feeder.

We like that they are a little minty so they help with her breath. She loves them because they are tasty and chewy. They do however, speed things up in the bathroom department (if you catch my drift) so definitely use in moderation, especially if your dog has a more sensitive stomach. The first time she ate some, she went #2 pretty quickly after. But now that she is use to them, she's back to her regular schedule.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These smell great like peppermint it is the last ingredient on their list. My dog likes them. I originally got them for his large tire to put in the crease which they sorta fit they are a little small but if I put them close to the outside they fit fine.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">1 dog loved it but threw up multiple times after 2, other dog was repulsed and refused.

It helps to make the chew toy last longer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I just put this together for my guy, and as soon as I took it out of the box he was sitting there ready to chew on it!!  He loves it so much that I already know I'll have to order more. It seems to be hard enough that he actually has to work but since he can get yummy chews off of it, he remains occupied.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">couldn’t get the stick through the rings and one broke just in the trying.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog constantly needs to be busy, so finding interactive toys and treats are a must.

He's smart and can usually figure out how to work through all his new toys, but adding this twist to it allowed me about an hour of relax time watching him, and he was totally entertained!  SO worth it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought these for a treat dispensing ball I cut too many nubs off and the kibble just pours out.  Wanted something to make use of the ball till our 12 week pup has bigger kibble to put in the ball.  
He paid absolutely no mind to this toy in his crate.  
After a few days of it being untouched I went ahead and took the treat part out of the ball and just gave him the treat assembled like a “barbell” now he loves it! And he looks hilarious running around with it in his mouth.  
Not sure how long it will last, but looks like it might last a while for a puppy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was happy when my dog took to this right away! I have a Aussie Cattle Lab and i ordered the Starmark treat ball for these to go in and she hovered over me while i screwed it into the ball. It didn’t last as long as I hoped but it lasted longer than a bully stick and she enjoyed chewing it until the treats came off the ball and even finished up the last crumb. Would buy these again because it gives her something different to do.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Both flower shaped pieces snapped in half when I went to screw them on.....defeats the purpose of this as an interactive toy but my dog was still happy to chew up the pieces. Only lasted a couple minutes for a moderate, chewer, 40lb dog</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">For my hard chewers, I'll stick to the plain insertsble starmarks versus the screw on</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Had initially thought, this is a lot of treat eaten if its not a challenge for my pups. I prepped by feeding my dogs half portion of their dinner. 

My BF said, should leave the interlocking part out, looks way too easy. I said, lets just use the treat as it was intended. 

So I ended tried to break the locku g rod in half almost believing that they could use the rod as a pulling strategy to get both disks out. 

We'll what happens is they chew off the nubs and yup, no more leg up in the challenge.

It does its job I suppose but I'm worried its expired or something.

While I was first overjoyed that this flavor doesn’t stink like the cheese &amp; bacon one, I was quickly reminded that dogs gravitate towards stinky treats, especially my picky husky. This has absolutely no smell to it, which makes me also wonder if there’s any liver flavor at all (not that I’ve got the guts to taste test myself lol). With the pasty whitish color, it reminds me of toothpaste. No wonder she could care less about it. 

My dog’s preferences aside, the nozzle on the bottle I got was finicky from the beginning and dispensed the paste veeeery slowly</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have given our Blue Heeler all of the flavors of the Kong easy treat but the only one we've been disappointed in was the liver recipe. Not sure if it has to do with the actual liver option or if we got a bad batch, but it was as runny as water. It does not stay inside the Kong toy and creates a huge mess. I will continue with the other flavors but will not purchase this one again. You can see the difference in consistency in the photo I attached. The liver recipe is the one on the right.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Normally these are great but the last 3 that I have gotten have been extremely runny and watery so have been wasted going on the floor.

When I bought it, I didn't realize it was a level two game, none the less they both seemed to learn it fairly fast, enjoy playing it and get satisfaction out of it. I always praise them upon finding the treats, but the reason for four stars instead of five is my Bullypit like to take the vertical solitaire pieces and try and use them as a chew toy sometimes, so close supervision is needed to make sure they don't choke. All in all I think this is a wonderful puzzle to help give some mental stimulation as well as fun for both pet and pet parent.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I would recommend this for small dogs. It's on the small side so for bigger dogs, I think it would be too small. I have a young dog who is about 20 lbs right now, and it's essentially perfect for his size. He has a great time snuffing it out. Something to keep in mind is that once they figure it out, they have it down almost every time. He got it after 2 tries and now can finish it in a few minutes. I still like using it for him because he really gets excited, I've just spaced out how often I bring it out so that maybe he takes a little longer with it. It does have some challenging aspects that he struggled with at first. Even the cat tries to get in on it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Sassy my 11 week old Cocker Spaniel solves this in about 5 minutes. It was so fun watching her solve it. It did not surprise us that she solved it that fast. We got her at 9 weeks old and at 10 weeks old was already fetching. She has mastered sitting and also settle which is down for most dogs but we wanted to save down to stop jumping. I recommend this toy. Even since she was so fast at it it was fun and ran off some energy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was bought for my little dogs birthday and she loves it! Of course it ended up being tried by all of them and my larger dog seemed to have issues with it cause his nose/paw was too big. The product works great but just a heads up for anyone buying for a larger breed! It definitely keeps my entertained for a bit though!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My red heeler loves doing this puzzle but it's too easy for him. It only takes him a couple minutes and he shows no signs of being tired afterwards. Wish it could fit more food so I could feed him his meals with it more easily. It also requires close supervision to ensure he doesn't just pick it up and throw it or otherwise destroy it to get to the food. Probably better for more delicate dogs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I initially bought this for my neighbors dog. When my neighbor said he took no interest in it I brought it home and tried it on my dog and she LOVES it! It is so fun to watch her open the latches and try to figure it out. I definitely recommend this product!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a two-year-old female French Bulldog, who a trainer once described as ""Deeply food motivated."" She's not the sharpest tool in the shed when it comes to spacial awareness or dexterity but, boy, does she love this toy. We used it the first few times together -- I showed her the little trap door and other obstacles. Now, she's off to the races and gets the treats out in no time flat. She never gets tired of it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Pup is too smart and I needed something to challenge him. He figured out the sliders and lifters in no time flat but the lever doors are still a challenge. He keeps at it until he finds all the hidden treats. I just use his regular dry food but he doesn't care as he likes the hunt rather than the prize.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the first puzzle game either of my dogs have tried. My German Shepherd figured it out pretty quickly but really enjoys it. My mastiff needs to use it at a slower pace and occasionally will give up, but overall she likes it a lot too! 
It also gets my GSD to eat his meals better if I have him solve the puzzle for his food.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this for my pug puppy but realized it was too difficult for him, so I held onto it until he was a bit older. Now he loves this puzzle! I fill this about 3 times a meal (to equal 1/2 cup food) and it takes him about 20min to finish eating instead of the usual 2min with a normal bowl. It makes him sniff out the food, and once he knocks down the towers he rolls it around the floor for a while to empty it - it's great!

When she's not looking or chasing one of the dinosaurs, we sneak them back into the volcano for non-stop play.  We don't leave this toy out all of the time, so it's new fun everything we do.  Today when I picked it up after we played with it, she cried.  You can't get a better review than that.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It is very difficult to find a toy that our Belgian malinois shepherd won't destroy in 5 minutes. To say she's an aggressive chewer is an understatement...and I was aware that this specifically said NOT for aggressive chewers. So, needless to say, we were very skeptical when ordering this toy, but it was too darn cute not to try. She loves to play hide-n-seek with her ball amongst old towels, so I thought we'd give it a shot. SO glad we did!  She went nuts over it!  She did eventually de-squeaked the squeakers in all but one of the baby dinos, so far, but it took awhile, which we were surprised and pleased. She still enjoys chewy on the dinos a lot, even though they don't squeak - go figure!  </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy satisfies the urge to rip things apart, but all you have to do is refill the volcano with the dinos. The area around the holes has a few nibble marks already, but this toy will still provide plenty of entertainment for time to come. My dog is able to remove the dinos pretty quickly, but continues to play with it after all the toys are refilled again. I'm sure if I left her alone with it she would rip apart, but working from home it helps to keep her distracted and I just replace the dinos after she's finished removing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">On the one hand, my pup has had an awesome day hunting for dinosaurs around the house! But... Within a few hours two of them have died gruesome deaths. I don't consider our puppy to he a super heavy chewer either. The legs are the first to go. 

The volcano seems to be doing better though, and I'm using it to hide other small balls and toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’ve been looking for toys to entertain my dog while we’re working from home and THIS IS IT! He loves being able to hunt and ‘dig’ a bit to find the dinosaurs. They’re a perfect size for him too. After a couple rounds of finding dinos he’s surprisingly tired out. So happy with this purchase!!! @jerrytherealfancyboy approved!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our three month old pup loves this. She can chew on the volcano, the dinosaurs, and she is slowly figuring out how to pull them out which makes it great for puppy mental stimulation. Entertainment for at least a half hour as she goes back and forth between all the dinosaurs and works on getting them out of the volcano.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/frisco-hide-seek-plush-volcano-puzzle/dp/179588,puzzle toys & games,interactive toys

I have another hide n seek toy that’s a firework box I got off chewy and she loves that one so much, box and all. I wanted to get her another hide n seek toy because she loved the last one so much, I figured on getting this one because i see a lot of people with this particular style. She really likes the hedgehogs and so do my cats!! She also likes to chew on the burrow itself, I’ll put sojo treats in there and she goes crazy!! It’s a good brain game for her when she gets bored. I like that she enjoys the ENTIRE toy. The burrow came with a couple loose threads but I’m not worried.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought the volcano with little dinos and found that Chad the Corgi didn't care much for the volcano but loved carrying the little dinos everywhere. Since then I've found other ""refill"" animals like these meerkats and the hedgehogs as well as the little dino refills. All of these little things are his favorite things to run around squeaking and taking on car rides and sleeping with. I will continue buying the little refill animals - he just loves them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a 10 week old Cockapoo who loves this toy more than anything.  He spends a lot of time pulling the hedgehogs out of the den and then we play fetch with them. He’s actually happy to just stick his head into the empty den and play with it as is. Great toy and so happy that we purchased it. Highly recommended.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Had gotten this hedgehog den with 3 squeaky hogs for our Golden when she was a pup. She loved the hogs but the den wasn’t necessary and got chewed up later in adulthood. Now with a new Golden pup, she found a hog in the bottom of the toy box and carried it everywhere. So I bought 3 hog replacements and they are her squeaky favorite to carry and squeak!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 4 month old basset puppy loves pulling the hedgehogs out and squeaking them. Great for beginners but she figured this out in about 15 mins. Still loves to play with it though and keeps her busy for awhile once she’s pulled them out. Would not recommend for power chewers or big dogs as it is pretty small. Great for introducing our puppy to puzzle toys!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy saved our sanity and many bandaids. We have a very nippy puppy who needs lots of activity and stimulation. This toy provides hours of fun without sacrificing our arms and hands to sharp little teeth. We purchased the refill after 3 weeks of use because she likes to hide the hedgehogs around the house and she has punctured one of the squeaker inserts. Not a big deal. Totally worth it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I am writing this review about 10 minutes after receiving my order and giving this toy to my dog. I found this toy as a ""recommendation for large dogs"" and I figured since it was more like a puzzle toy it would last a bit longer than it did (she has had similar toys before and some held up for months). Needless to say, the hedgehogs didnt stay in very well and she was able to get all three out in a matter of minutes and she has already destroyed one, likely would be two if I hadn't put the remaining two back in the den. I expected her to quickly destroy the little guys once she got them out, but didnt think it would take her less than five minutes to get all three out. I dont recommend this if</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My elderly small dog (16lb, 12 yr old) and my medium sized 7 month old puppy love this toy. My puppy needs to be supervised very closely as he loves to tear things apart. The puppy loves to pull the toys out of the log and get so excited when he is successful. My elderly dog loves to squeak them and licks them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our two kittens LOVE these types of hide and seek toys - so this was an instant hit. The brown plush the hedgehogs hide in are perfect for them to kick, and the hedgehogs are the perfect size for them to toss and chase around! Plus they roll pretty nicely. Wish there was some crinkle in the bigger plush toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 8lb Minature Dachshund LOVED this toy the second it came out of the box, however, the ""burrow"" you put the hedgehogs in is not very sturdy or durable... at all. She was able to chew clean through it in a matter of 20-30 minutes &amp; she is not a chewer. This is literally the first thing I've ever seen her destroy. Needless to say, I'll be tossing the hideaway &amp; just let her have the hedgehogs.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/zippypaws-burrow-squeaky-hide-seek/dp/131387,puzzle toys & games,interactive toys

The first time I used this toy, I used the “easy” setting for the bones and tied string on some, as well as leaving some compartments open, per the instructions. He really isn’t the brightest bulb in the chandelier, but he was through the whole puzzle in about a minute. The next time, I put the bones on the more difficult  position and didn’t leave any uncovered. It took him a little longer, but only because he has a severe underbite and has difficulty grasping the bones in his mouth.

I was so excited it’s hard enough for her that she can’t just gobble up the treats but easy enough where she doesn’t loose her attention because she isn’t getting rewarded. This is probably my favorite buy and I am looking forward to getting harder ones for her.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">All those little bones must be removed to fill the toy, then picked up after being strewn around the room by the dog.  My dog didn't even hesitate the first time he was given the toy - he just went ahead and pawed at the little bones and about 1/2 of them flew out of the holder.  No challenge for him at all.  In fact, I think I have more challenge filling and putting it together than he does taking it apart.  My dog is a border collie, so maybe the toy is more appropriate for a smaller, less ""enthusiastc"" dog?</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this  for a new dog I am getting.

The few minutes he did play with it, the pieces were throughout the room.
 I will look for more challenging and one piece puzzle.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Finley loves this puzzle!

I can’t take him outside as often due to the high heat where we live so he started to seem a little bored and sad, so I thought this would be a good idea. He loves it so much. At first he wasn’t interested in it, but after a little coaxing with peanut butter he was very excited to play. He sniffs out his treats and then when he finds them all he tries to put the bones back in place and then begs for us to put treats in it again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My name is Chloe.

I got this toy for her because she loves enrichment/puzzle toys, I was worried it would be too hard for her because it was level 2 (intermediate) but it was fine! She learned how to play with it after a few days... that’s why I love that it came with three bone toys you can add to it to make it harder. It spins so well and is super fun. Sometimes she will bark during dinner so I give it to her and it keeps her busy all through dinner. I also add her food to the toy when she won’t eat and she will eat her food!

It easily fits his meal in it (1/2 cup dry food) but since he's learned it he can empty it pretty quickly. The covers are great to add a bit more of a challenge but since he's a pug and doesn't really have a muzzle they're a bit hard for him to remove.

The first couple times I used without the “bone covers” for some of the pockets for treats. She was interested and easily accessed and ate the treats.

Yes, it only takes her five minutes to complete, but it is hands down her favorite toy. Now, I’ve seen a lot of comment saying it’s flimsy or poorly made ect. but I would disagree. However, it also depends on how your fur baby is with their toys. If they are hard core chewers and chew on most anything probably not the best option for them. Yes the lids do pop off and the red compartments can come out, but they are easily put back in place no damage.

I have to keep an eye on them as they will pull out the drawer and take off with it to chew as well. It’s fun to see them nose around and paw at it trying to get the treats out. Some parts easier than others, still fun. And no, it won’t keep them busy for hours, but for mine a good 10 min or more which is good stimulation. I have a different puzzle as well so I swap them out when using them</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Shelties are too smart for their own good! Grayson has six puzzles he plays on a daily rotation...other easy ones have been given away...but this puzzle is his all-time favorite. He takes puzzles seriously with lots of slobbering and use of both long snout and his left paw. 
Buy this puzzle for loads of fun times for both your pup and you. My favorite, too!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is still figuring this out, which is funny because we do scent games (she's a beagle mix) and I thought she'd get it sooner.(When she takes those two cover things out she thinks there's food inside them, like a kong!) If I'd started with one of the beginner games she'd have gotten it sooner, but it's actually great that she's taking some time to figure it out because it keeps her occupied longer. So I really do recommend this - it's more challenging than the others (I know dogs that have figured out the beginner ones immediately, rendering them useless!) I think it is well-made too. And I love Chewy -this arrived 2 days after I ordered it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this toy for my 6 month old Visla puppy and he loves ""playing"" with it. It keeps his attention, although it is definitely a toy to use under supervision. He hasn't quite figured out the lever movement but watching him figure out how to pull the string to get a treat was a joy. This definitely stimulates his mind and helps to tire him out mentally.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My two golden retrievers are pretty excited about this toy. They learned really fast how to move the sliders. The rope drawer not so much. Once the treats are gone they are off doing something else. One of my dogs took the removable pieces and wanted to chew on them. You have to participate with them, so it’s fun for all of us.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This might be a great toy for a smaller dog or one who, uh, isn't that bright?  My dog (60 pounds and really good at puzzles) had this one figured out and emptied in about ten seconds.  I also was not comfortable with the two round pieces that are easily pulled out as part of the game.  They are too small for my dog to play with and not be concerned that he might choke on them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this to keep my lab busy while I got stuff done since she’s a Velcro dog and I am so happy I did.  It took a little bit of time for her to get the hang of it, not sure I was teaching her the right way, but once she figured it out she didn’t care if I walked away from her to do other stuff</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So I have two dogs. Bear is an Aussie mix and nala is a GSD. Bear LOVES puzzles. I set this up for him in my office while I work to keep him entertained (or else he keeps trying to get me to play fetch while I’m working). Being a level three, he’s having some struggles, but is determined to get the snackos! Keeps him entertained enough for me to get my work done without having him mope around the house when I can’t play.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The only parts that are worth anything are the piece your dog needs to pull the rope and the lever. The other parts are completely useless especially for a level 3. My dog still did this within a few minutes. These companies are thinking our dogs are stupid.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 12 pound Schnoodle loves this.  She had perfected the Level 2 game toy and is now working on this one.  She expects me to get it out each evening.

He knows names of his toys so we named them Dino. Problem is the squeaker didn’t last but a couple days! Says refills but I don’t see any Velcro.

A little disappointed on that.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought our 8yr old beagle, Jack, the Volcano and Dinosaurs puzzle to celebrate our 22 yr Anniversary. Jack can be a powerful chewer at times but he seems to take extra care when he plays with his puzzles. Jack will remove a squeaker from 1 or 2 of the dinosaurs and then leave the rest alone because he likes them to squeak. Make sure to supervise your babies.  We play hideaway with Jack and his puzzles and we tug with the puzzle pieces or throw the pieces for him to catch;he loves all that.  After awhile, Jack will walk away and play with something else but a day later he always comes back and plays again.  It's a great toy and we are glad our beagles love it. Thanks again!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">They are really cute and Riley loves them.  We didn’t get the volcano with them since we have a bird house and squirrel tree to hide them in.  They fit no problem.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Cooper, our three year old Cocker Spaniel, simply destroys his toys. He is particularly fond of any soft toy with a squeaker, and will literally rip toys apart until he gets to the squeaker part. (Even toys that claim to be for power chewers, are indestructible, or have squeakers that keep on squeaking even if popped.) Needless to say, he is NEVER left alone with a squeaker toy, and we go through A LOT of toys. 

So when my daughters wanted to get him these dinosaurs, with the volcano, I was sure they would be ripped apart within minutes. To my surprise they were not! He loves to have us hide the dinos in the volcano, and waits, tail wiggling, until they are all in the volcano and he can pull</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My large dogs love to play with small stuffies. Because they don't tend to last long, I like to find toys that aren't very expensive. Frisco hide and seek refills are perfect. A pack of three for less than 6 dollars is great.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Beagle is a huge chewer. I have been buying every sturdy type game of bone that could endure her chewing. I bought these on a whim because they seemed fun in the volcano - like a game to get them out. He got them out in a heartbeat. The funny part - he carries these around the house like babies. They squeak so we play fetch - he brings to me (but won't let go) - and I throw a different one. He drops the one he has and goes for the next one. I squeak them to get his attention. I always know when he wants to play now - as he brings these to me!

She's played with Kong toys before but this was her first experience with a puzzle like this. I'm very happy with the quality of the puzzle, as it seems very sturdy and well-made. It was challenging for her without being frustrating, and it kept her busy and calm for a few minutes. I like how you can adjust the difficulty, so when she gets bored I can start using the locking mechanic. I wouldn't leave this sitting around if she were a big chewer, though.

She found this puzzle a lot easier than the Dog Casino, which she still hasn't figured out yet. I'm glad I got both so I can give her some variety.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 5mo old German Shepherd/Great Pyr mix loves this toy. It keeps his mind and body busy, he easily caught on to both levels of difficulty, then realized how he could rip out the pins in such a way they can never again be put back into the puzzle. It lasted almost two full months I think. 

That said, my puppy is a BEAST - he is 60 pounds, tall, strong, a true working dog. He can pull like my Newf. He also has the spirit and energy of Tigger. The two months were worth the investment but I won’t replace it w/another only b/c I don’t want to create even more landfill. We’ll stick to nose-work and higher energy pursuits. Lord help me.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog needs difficult puzzles or she is finished too quickly.  This takes time.  I haven't added the locks yet because she has had trouble with those on another puzzle.  This one was enough of a challenge though still plan to go further later. It's fun to watch her reason this one through.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog didn't understand the pull feature and just scraped the top blue parts. This meant she would accidentally re-lock the white pull tabs when knocking it around, It broke after a few attempts at entertaining her. She's done a few other puzzles, but this was not for my pup. Perhaps yours will be more entertained?</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is definitely a learning toy.  So far Callie loves it. I use her dry dog food as ""treats"" and she likes that.  Pulling out the white ""locks"" is still troubling but she really works at it. I believe she will have learned how pretty soon.  It does wear her out and works her brain.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 1 year old border collie sort of likes it. He figured it out but I wish it came with a booklet of various combinations to try to keep him interested.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Great concept. Unless your dog is a major chewer. Apparently our new little guy is. The toy was immediately engaging for both out dogs. The mulutiple challenges occupied them for a good half hour at a time.

He prefers to “earn” his food over eating out of a bowl, so I put his food in this toy, and he goes nuts trying to slide the tiles.

My dog has never chewed on it (unheard of) and it is in great shape despite being used several times a week for the past 2 years. Highly recommend this puzzle. If your dog is new to puzzles this would be a great one to start with.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My nine week old puppy loves to do this puzzle. He is always very excited when I pull it out, but he finishes it in about thirty seconds or less. Not a hard puzzle for dogs at all if my puppy can do it that fast.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have had this toy for about 3 years now. Only one of the few that's lasted through the years. I love that there are no loose pieces that our dog could chew off or we could lose track of. It's super easy to hide kibble or small treats and it keeps our dog occupied for a while as she sniffs and moves the pieces around to get her treats. Would highly recommend this for any dog!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 4 month old lab/border/hound mix figured this out within a minute. However, she still has so much fun with it! We reserve some of her breakfast and go 3-5 rounds every morning and she never gets bored. She chews on it a bit, but it seems surprisingly sturdy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog love this toy, and I like that it is not an eye sore sitting in our living room. You can essentially set it up to have different levels by using the flaps or not, I personally like to change it up. You can put food in the big hole, for your dog to uncover, or place food into the smaller hole on top of the slider for them to solve. The process is this after filling the slider: dog has to move flap to expose the hole, then slide the slider over the hole to drop the treat, then slide it back to reveal the treat. It took a little for me to figure out to place food into the smaller holes (I thought it was just for sniffing). This could be why people are upset that their dogs figured it out </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The puzzle itself is sturdy, made of good material and doesn't slip on the wood floor which is great.  I gave it 3 stars because I don't think it should be listed as Intermediate skill level.  My rescue pooch - who we think is some sort of border collie mix - figured it out in less than 10 seconds.  My puggle would likely take longer to figure it out.  If your dog is super smart, I wouldn't spend my money on this toy and would look for something else.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/nina-ottosson-by-outward-hound-hide-n/dp/175427,puzzle toys & games,interactive toys

Other reviewers are correct in saying that you shouldn't leave your pooch unattended while he plays with this puzzle. As he solves the pieces of the puzzle, small parts (lids, drawers etc) come off and if you don't remove them, he'll probably start chewing on them. I saw 2 Great Pyrenees puppies play with it and they loved it. My adult border collie solved one piece and lost interest. My sister's mixed breed adult dog was completely uninterested. So it's not for every dog but if your dog is into it, it's a winner.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My furbabies are about 5 months old and they absolutely love this toy!  One of them mastered the game pretty quickly but will still actively play since there are treats involved.  The other one is still working on it - he has figured out 2 of the 4 treat locations.  I would rate this product with 5 stars except the quality could be a little better.  The string from one of the drawers broke and I don’t see a way to fix it.  All in all, it’s a good toy and your dogs will enjoy it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It has been so fun to watch my dog get excited about and play with this hide and seek style treat toy.  It took her a handful of times to learn what to do, then she was off and away.  If we put it away for awhile, it's not so easy for her yet that she gets bored with it.  It still takes her a little bit of work to remember what she did before to find the treat.  She loves it !</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this for my dog Peanut when he was 5 months old as we noticed he would go through level 1 puzzles like nothing and 10 months later He still gets super excited every time he sees it. If your dog doesn’t get it I would highly recommend to take the time and train your dog and not just toss it and expect your dog to get it abefore giving a bad review, this is a great product</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Despite our puppy’s desire to “bulldoze” through food puzzles, this puzzle has lots of clever engineering features to prevent him from tearing it apart. I definitely wouldn’t leave him alone with it, but at least he cannot flip the board over and cheat open the boxes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our doodle only selectively chews on toys.  He has soft toys that he carefully handles.  I gave him this toy while I was working, and I only had to turn away for a moment before he was chewing it up.  Its going to take major work just to make it reusable.  He thought chewing on it was much more interesting than solving it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is an awesome game.  Each quadrant can be detached and taught individually, then put back together and let the fun begin.  This is 4th game we have purchased through Chewy.  Pups are smarter than you think and gives them the brain stimulation that is so important.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It's definitely something that you'll most likely have to teach your dog to use, but, that's also part of the fun. I like that it's versatile and you can change it up to add levels of difficulty. It also comes with a pamphlet to help you train your dog at using it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog has separation anxiety, and the behavior vet said we could ONLY feed him out of puzzles from now on. I admit my dog figured this out embarssingly quickly (maybe 2-3 feedings before he had it down pat) but we still use it from time to time to shake things up, and he gets so excited when he sees it. The top rope handle was hardest for him to figure out, but now that he knows it, it's the first one he does. It's like he relishes in his victory over it. Definitely recommend!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We played together with it, then I made the mistake of leaving it on the floor during dinner. It took Sadie all of 15 minutes to destroy the lid of one of the boxes!

Different sizes for different pets. I recently purchased these to make a mobile I'm hanging up in their cat room, for my Game of Thrones Feral kittens I rescued 3 years ago. Khal Drogo, Arya, Tyrian, Jon Snow, and Khalissi  all love these Frisco toys (squirrels, raccoons, aliens, T-rex) and spend hours playing with them. They are so cute and well made, your kids will want to play with them too. Khalissi can finally have her 3 Dragons flying</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My best dogfriend, Agnes, loves this kind of toy. Weirdly, unlike MANY stuffed toys, she doesn't immediately eviscerate these little dragon buds...she probably heard about that fire-breathing thing, so she's extra nice to them.
The castle itself is pretty burly, too. For this price, this is a great toy, and Agnes sure seems to have fun with it. :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I purchased this set of toys for my 5lb pomeranians and they love them!

You can also buy replacement dragons if anything happens which is great.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought 2 dragon puzzles for our beagles, Jack 8yrs old and Minnie 4yrs old. Minnie is in the attached picture.  Minnie removed all the squeakers after an hour of playing with us and Jack.  We tugged with the dragons, threw them for catch, played hideaway with the dragons and Minnie decided to take 1 of her dragons out to go potty.  She then decided to cuddle with all her dragons for a nap and we took a picture.  Jack played all day long with his dragons and castle.  The squeakers are still in the dragons.  He loves toys to squeak!! We played catch with him too, hideaway and tug also...after awhile Jack cuddled with his babi too. Great toy but puppies must be watched because of the squeakers</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is adorable and my 7 month old puppies were so excited about it but one of them gnawed the open and ripped it within the first minutes of play.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Sturdy feeling, dragons are stuffed well, seams sewn well.  My little guy loves it! BUT!  I do want to warn others, while playing he forces his head thru the holes and gets his head stuck-to the point he has to be helped to get it off, lol.  It is soft, so toy doesn't hurt him, but he runs into everything in sight panicking because he has no way to pull it off. I make sure to put it away when I leave for now, hes only 2 months old.  Im sure he grow enough it wont be an issue soon, but did want to tell others.  I also bought the extra dragons theres plenty of room to add them now or his other balls/small toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I purchased for my pup to keep him entertained when I go to work as he has become destructive after having me home for 8 weeks during Covid.

I would suggest buying the dragon refill pack with this item since the castle is a good size and can definitely hold more than 3 dragon toys.

Dog was monitored while using as advised and I had to quickly remove toy and throw away during first use.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pets love this toy and I would have given it 5 stars but it didn’t survive my dog Milo. He really likes trying to get the treats out but he pawed it to the point one of the screws fell out. We can’t find it. I would recommend for smaller pets. My cats and ferrets love using and it’s the right durability for them. Even without one of the screws they can still play with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I wanted to order this toy for a while, but I was hesitant because of the size. It works fine for my Cavalier.  There are training instructions included, but I didn’t read them. I sat with her once or twice and she figured it out.  She used her nose and her paws to flip the tubes.  I do watch her with it because she sometimes tries to chew the screws, but then after a quick redirect she goes back to the tubes.  I also ordered the windmill, which is a level 1, after she had this toy. Both are fine and she likes them. She does have to work more for the kibble when it’s in the mad scientist.  There are two covers for the tubes. Her kibble works better with the one large hole. If you have small kibble</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog, a miniature pinscher, loves this toy! It’s been my saving grace while working from home during covid. My big ask from the maker is, please sell replacement screw on tops! The toy comes with 6 tops- 3 with a large hole and 3 with 3 smaller holes. I use the smaller hole version to keep him busier longer but he tends to chew the lids to get the few pieces that don’t spin out, out. I use the small Zukes circle treats and while most of them fit perfectly, there are a few odd shaped ones just large enough to not come out. Thus, those lids are now chewed up pretty bad. Rated a 4 because of the lid issue.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 3 year old Dobie who gets extremely bored when she's in the house. At first when I bought it, she didn't care for it. I'm thinking she didn't because she was still adjusting after we rescued her. But after a few weeks, I brought it out again and she watched as I put the treats inside. It took her about a half hour to get all the treats out. I'm happy that it made her think in ways she wasn't used to. The pictures below feature the lid with the one big hole. I might have to use the smaller ones now that she's accustomed to it. Definitely love the toy and how she interacts with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">accidently left the toy out for the dog when I left the room. Didn't think anything of it.

Hmmmm.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 4 year old cattle dog mix  kind of beat the system at first haha, she just bit the caps off and then turned the tubes over for the treats to fall out! A little correcting,  and this game is very fun for her! My puppy also enjoys flipping the tubes!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">my dog figured this out quickly, but when she figured it out, she realized she could just chew off the tops and eat the toys faster than waiting for them to come out of the dispenser. Great idea, just needs to be made of more durable plastic, feels like a water bottle cap and she got it off on the first tike using it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">If you follow the included directions that layout how to get your pup interested in this toy it will certainly become one of their favorite! My dog doesn't give up until all the kibble is gone and it takes him a bit of time (having a dog engaged in an activity is GOLD for all you fellow high energy dog owners). One star removed for the annoying screw bolt that constantly loosens and becomes a chew toy. Another gripe is that it can easily be knocked over but we put 2 8 pound hand weights on the base and that seems to work with our muscle laden 50 lb Boxer Pitt.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/trixie-mad-scientist-turn-around/dp/146131,puzzle toys & games,interactive toys

The product is plastic so I can definitely see that if not monitored she could probably chew right through it. Although I’m not too worried right now since she gets tired from it rolling away from her and takes a break. Score! (Sometimes I can’t play so this toy is awesome) I got a size small and she is about 45lbs, perfect size for her to hold. Shipping was fast as well, thanks chewy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is obsessed with this ball. He loves to play soccer around the yard with this yipping and barking as he tries to get the inside ball. Once he tires out he will lay down and try to pull the small ball out. This toy was originally bought for another dog who didn’t have interest in it, but mine absolutely loves it. He has had this toy for over a year and a half - and spent a lot of time trying to get it apart and has just succeeded! He plays with both pieces still. He is a super chewer but surprisingly it took time to chew through this toy. This was well worth the money and will be buying again. Great to play with your dog with and to occupy your dog in its own.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our girl, Nagi Bear has zero interest in this ball. Which is a real bummer because it was suggested to me for our super chewer. Unfortunately, when we opened it and gave it to her she just pushed it around for a few seconds with her nose and walked away. The next morning I took it outside to the yard to see if kicking it around would entice her but still no interest. She found more joy sniffing the grass blades individually, lol. This is probably a great toy for some, Nagi Bear just didn't get it. I gave it two stars for durability and speed of shipment.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a Belgian Malinois so to say he needs tough toys that keep him entertained is an understatement. We love this ball because it actually keeps him very entertained, he will run around with it all day. 
I would say the only problem for me is the weight, my dog slams it into the fence and it’s broken a couple fence boards in half. 
I definitely will buy it again, I’ll probably just not leave it in the yard for him unsupervised.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This states on the box it is not a chew toy. It is not. My large 6 month old German Shepherd puppy enjoyed this for a short time but when he realized the inside ball would not come out he got bored with it and would start to chew it or pick it up and carry it along and drop it and ignore it. It’s hard plastic so you do have to watch your dog with it that he doesn’t chew the plastic into sharp edges.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball would be great for dogs who don’t grip down super tight on it. We have two German Shepherds and they like the ball but in just a few days, put groves in the hard plastic leaving sharp edges all over it. We are concerned they might get cut on the edges. On a positive side it is a fun ball for our shepherd who holds another toy in his mouth and plays with the ball as if he were playing soccer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My two-year-old lab has destroyed many toys in just minutes. She’s had this magical blue ball for about four months, and is still completely enraptured. Just infatuated by it. It’s sturdy enough to handle her teeth and interesting enough to keep her focus for HOURS on end. Chesler is extremely social and usually jumps on people when they come in the house. But when people come over to hang out in the yard, I give her this magical blue ball and she couldn’t care less about the visitors. It’s a great party trick, because no one has ever seen a dog so transfixed. It is my only rival for the position of her best friend, and I’m totally okay with that.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">He really enjoys playing with this in the yard. He is a super chewer and this does the trick to occupy him, but I'm worried that the bite marks on the plastic are going to cut his mouth. Kind of wish the plastic was thicker (like kong material).</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a very busy Corgi puppy. She enjoys playing with this altho she isn’t super fascinated by it. It is sturdy and will hold up to her hard chewing. She can make a bit of racket throwing it about as the outer ball is hard plastic. If you live in an apartment and your dog really goes nuts playing with it this could be something to be aware of. It helps keep her occupied tho.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Sorry to say my two fur loves do not like the teaser ball . Maybe it’s the hard plastic ?? They LOVE their other jolly puncture proof balls  That we play w all day every day outside in the yard . Especially our 2 year old shepherd . Our lab is 6 almost 7 and she just LOVES the water and kiddie pool nowadays</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/jolly-pets-teaser-ball-dog-toy-blue-8/dp/38800,puzzle toys & games,interactive toys

The monkeys are cute and luckily my pups still enjoy playing just with those but the tree is going in the trash.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have Labradors. While we would never leave this toy with them alone, it's a ton of fun watching them find the monkeys and proudly present them to us. We have even had a group play together with it. The little squeaky toys are not sturdy enough to hold up to their enthusiasm, however, so we must rescue them promptly. It served our purpose: a fun time of fetch, find, and frolic.

He had it with him in his crate  with  dry food in it. Within the first 4 minutes he broke off two of the three  flippers causing broken plastic pieces in his crate that he tried to eat!. Fortunately, I was right there and able to remove it and pick up the pieces. I wanted to love it so much, but had to return it as it broke within 4 min. He is not an excessive chewer.. probably a normal 40lb 7mos  old chewer. Maybe good for an older dog, but would not recommend for any energetic/puppy type dog. Really disappointed at how quickly it broke and that he would have eaten the plastic if I was not there.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this for our Beagle. She is always looking for things to get into, and does! Like a toddler and true to her breed, nothing is sacred if left within reach (or not). This is the first puzzle I ever had and found it to be very challenging for her. I didn’t realize puzzles had stages to them. The “disc” in the middle is certainly for a more experienced gamer. When I ordered it, I was concerned about the durability and was amazed how sturdy this puzzle is! Not many toys survive my pack! With that being said, you can be confident that this is not some run of the mill cheap plastic toy that will break the first time your fur baby uses it. If you are looking to buy a puzzle for the first time</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 15-week-old bordoodle figured the puzzle out in seconds. No challenge whatsoever. It could be the breed - part border collie / part poodle / very smart.  Also, she chewed one of the levers on day 1 (NOT so smart) and it now has that gnawed-on look. Not the end of the world, but I'll need to give it to my puppy only 10 minutes at a time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loved this puzzle! There are so many places to hide treats that he really had to work at it to find them all. Whenever I bring it out there is lots of tail wagging.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Great mental stimulation for my 8 month old lab. He figured out the outer circle within 5 minutes. It took a couple of weeks for him to figure out the inner circle. Because he’s a chewer we only let him have this once a day with supervision.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I am not happy to have something that was clearly used.  I am worried about the sanitation.  What is up with this?</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My corgi eats all of her daily meals from this toy. She eats fast, and i mean her meal is gone in 6 seconds (timed) if fed from a bowl. And then, as one does eating that stupid fast, she regurgitates. This breed is made for food puzzles, so it only takes her about 2 minutes to clear it out, but that was enough to allow her system to produce enough saliva and enzymes to handle a meal. This is a difficult puzzle. I wouldn’t buy it unless your dog has already cleared an easier style. My larger breeds gave up after 20 seconds and didn’t care enough to continue to try - the corgi liked to have had a coronary over this. I’ll also say, the corgi is an older girl, and she’s got considerably more pep </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a very durable puzzle that definitely resists chewing and clawing.  The small pockets all over the puzzle hold a few pieces of kibble so there are a lot of areas to be uncovered.  The toy is fairly heavy so a medium sized breed will not easily slide it on a hard surface floor, but a larger dog could easily move it around.  Very high quality, holds up to dishwashing.  I have a whippet and he loves it and stays engaged about 10-15 minutes with it, until he finds all of the treats!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The people in my house weren't the only ones going a little stir-crazy with the lock down. Whenever I pull out this puzzle toy my dog gets so excited he can barely contain his wiggles. And this is the ONLY TOY I've gotten so far that he is yet to figure out! 100% recommend for smart dogs who get bored easy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Both dogs love this challenging toy!  Our terrier mix has more patience and focus to figure it out than our food-crazed beagle.  I recommend getting the level 1 and level 2 before graduating to this level 3 toy just because your dog will have less steps to learn to get to their treat or food so it may help them develop the skills needed for this challenging one.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/nina-ottosson-by-outward-hound-worker/dp/186160,puzzle toys & games,interactive toys

DO NOT RECOMMEND.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I saw a few reviews mentioning durability, but went ahead and gave it a try based on the price. Thought that wood would be strong enough to last a while, but this is a fiber board made toy, so it's very soft. Within 5 minutes, our 55lb dog broke one of the sliders by trying to pull it with his teeth and the upper part broke off. There were many chew marks on it just from getting into the sliders. The sliders are already very difficult to slide due to the chew marks after only 1 use. The fiberboard also absorbs drool like cardboard. We took it away after he got the food out so the chew marks are all just from him trying to get to the food. 

This toy is probably great for dogs that do not love</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Yorkie loves this toy, however, it’s made of cardboard like material and once it’s out of treats, my girls will dig at it and it tears up quite quickly, so it’s not idea for keeping a dog busy when you go out</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our little guy (mini Aussie, 28 lbs) LOVES this puzzle, in fact he gets all wiggly excited when we pull it out. I’ve found that he’s pretty clever about getting treats from humans, but he enjoys rooting around in puzzles to get fed too. Highly recommend, unless your dog is a big time chewer. It seems like particle board and some cheaper woods were used. Definitely a toy we give our pup while we are in the same room and just want a little break from the constant “Let’s play!” vibe Aussies always have.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog were trying to find the treats and she would bite into this cardboard/wood but I think it’s cardboard and then she try to eat the cardboard instead of the treat but she eat the treat but destroyed part of the puzzle.

It has a great reach so it's a great play toy when I'm in a bit of a lazier mood and don't want to be running around because I can just swing it and he'll go running after it. The rod part could potentially be a bit sturdier, but so far so good!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves this toy.. the only problem I have is that the little toy attached to the rope was torn apart by my dog in less than 2 days. He loved this toy so I hate that we had to take it away so soon.. but it is a fun way to play without worrying about your dog biting your hands on accident.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We recently got a maltipoo puppy and he's super energetic. This rope is one of his favorite toys! He loves tugging it. The rope material is soft and thin enough for him to chew. We love using this to get him to exercise; lots of running for him without much effort on from us -- what a lifesaver!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was really excited for this item because our trainer recommended it. It’s always been hard to find toys for our boxer/pit. It was fun in the beginning, but after a couple of strong pulls the stick snapped.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 12lbs dog is a VERY aggressive and energetic chewer. I knew this when buying product and assumed the plush ball would not last long, but for the price would be happy as long as the rope and wand held up. So far, since I have control during playtime, he is not able to sit and just gnaw at the plush ball so there is only a small rip and everything else is holding up quite well. He gets very excited when he sees this toy and it's an easy way for me to engage in playtime without having to exert too much effort.  Only issue I have is the twisting and loosening of the connecting wand pieces but is a quick fix.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is hands down my puppy’s favorite toy so far. She loves to play aggressively, chase, tug and chew. Her new fishing pole does all of those things in one. I am looking forward to an exhausted puppy tonight</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a very hyper and active 5 month old shih tzu pup and this toy has been a God send!!!  it's sturdy and he loves it!!! I don't actually let him bend the stick part, if he gets a good grip on the toy I grab the rope, the stick does come lose but not alot and if he gets the squeeky toy I gently take it off him and start over. Thank you, this toy gets that energy slowed down and we've gotten to enjoy some quiet time, with 2 dogs a cat and a bunny quiet time is nice, and now that he gets tuckered out he chases the cat less and she says Thank you as well. God Bless and stay safe.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/pet-fit-life-plush-wand-squeaky-dog/dp/167003,puzzle toys & games,interactive toys

The Twister was very intuitive for her, but the drawers on this one are quite difficult for her to figure out and she becomes frustrated after a while. I'm glad I got this one for when the Twister becomes boring, but I would consider this one much more difficult despite them both being a level 3. Both toys are very sturdy and well-made so no complaints there.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a small dog, about 12 pounds, who always gobbled her food.  So I bought this puzzle a few months ago  to give her a challenge and slow her eating habits.   I put dry kibble, wet food, and sometimes treats in it.  She figured out how to work it successfully pretty quick but still gets excited when I pull it off the shelf.  It's been a godsend in helping her eat her food a little slower.  She enjoys it even after these past few months.. so I guess it's worth recommending!   Easy to clean and easy to set up.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves this puzzle. Takes him 15 min or so to get all the drawers open. He hasn’t quite figured out the bone “locks”. He just paws as it and bangs it around and eventually a bone will fall into place and a drawer will open a little bit. The main part is very sturdy, but the drawers can be easily chewed. My dog is not much of a chewer and he still mangled one of the drawer handles. It still works, but if he chewed any other part of the drawer, it probably wouldn’t fit in the toy anymore.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this for my 3 year old mini schnauzer. He figured it out in 15 minutes and LOVES IT. Puzzle has become oe of his new favorite words. I don't leave him unsupervised and teach him not to knaw on the puzzle. Its pretty durable and it comes apart so its easy to keep clean. I will be buying more from outward hound in the future.

My order came early which was a nice surprise.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog, a Lakeland Terrier, sadly has outgrown playing with her toys.

So he is used to learning and listening.  He got this toy and of course dug at it and chomped down on the drawers to get them out.  But his chomping made the plastic move and then the drawers would not come out, even with the bone in the correct place.  Also, he chewed the rubber feet off the very first time he tried it.  I was scared he was going to swallow them, so had to take them off.

My 7month old aussie is obsessed with attention so I wanted something to occupy him when I cannot.  This toy is very affordable compared with other robotic dog toys and successfully entertains my puppy. It basically just vibrates and makes this sound like a barking + sniffing + whining puppy whenever it’s picked up.  Even though it makes the same annoying sound/vibration each time, it moves on the floor or bounces differently when it’s dropped and my puppy so far is not bored.

The on/off button was tricky to locate. Tough to get the fur off the plastic ball. When I opened the plastic ball housing it was very greasy. Keeping for now but would have loved to put the cost towards a better model. The manufacturer should build a better one and charge a little more. The bouncing action is its best feature.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this in March, never turned it off or changed the batteries and it still operates as should.

I've found that my dogs prefer their own toys (Liesl loves wobblers while Fritz likes flippers) and this toy has become Fritz' favorite. 

There are two sides that can be filled with a clear piece of plastic that separates the sides. As the dog flips and turns the saucer the kibble makes its way through a spiral on either side, as there's a dispenser on each side.  Being made of plastic, it makes noises on hardwoods/tile floors.  Yes, it finds its way under tables and couches.  

We use small kibble for dachshunds and this holds that type well without dispensing</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a good size toy for my 17 pound dog.

He never uses the toy unsupervised and doesn't chew unnecessarily on it, yet after 3 days, it's become unsafe for him.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog maybe had 15 minutes with it and the rubber was coming off and the plastic was coming apart super easy so now he just wants to chew the plastic instead of getting the treats out. Had to throw it away.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 95 lb pitbull/GSD loves this. He learned to flip it with his nose. My other large dog simply punches it with his paw. Both methods the food comes out easily. Takes them about 20 minutes to get all the food out. Probably holds about 1/3 cup altogether. Fill this up a few times about you’ve got an hour of “me” time!! It’s lightweight, and if a dog really wanted to chew it up, they could, but that behavior is also a byproduct of how much you watch and train your dog and take away the toy when the “reward” of food is gone so they know they can’t get any more if they work harder aka chew</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It’s a good design that would be fine for more average chewers.

Unfortunately the hard plastic that it’s made of is 1) very noisy on wooden floors and 2) where the end caps are “fused” onto the center part there is a weak seam. One day, Minutes after I gave it to him, my dog had torn the toy into two parts (destroyed). I consider him a moderate to high chewer. He LOVED this, but I can’t consider replacing it given that it would likely happen again. You can also notice that his teeth really did a number on the plastic- so I can’t recommend this for any but super gentle pups.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog LOVES this. He will sometimes even ignore his full bowl of kibbles in favor of the kibbles in this, because it's just more fun. Which is fine by me! Makes him use his brain and keeps him busy.

I'd suggest showing your pup how to get the kibbles out of it the first time. We had a different dog whose solution to any treat dispensing toy was just to destroy it. Obviously these toys aren't built for that and won't stand up to much of that abuse.

The one lesson we learned is that he now only gets it in his playpen, to prevent it (and the kibbles) from rolling under or behind furniture and getting stuck, causing frustration for him and us. We keep the door of the pen open - he can come and</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was working with my dog to show him how this worked. We were on the floor rolling it back and forth for 5-6 minutes. Food rarely came out. I left for about 3 minutes and came back and he had it chewed up. I guess he was impatient. I would have thought it would have lasted longer. Probably had the toy for 10 minutes before it was destroyed. I never thought he would destroy it in less than 3 minutes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 75lb pittbull.  I bought the large and he loved it.  It is big enough that he can pick it up but too big for him to bite down.  I have to monitor him while he plays with it.  Yes he was able to pop the side panel out.  I put it back in and he popped it out again.  That panel doesn't have to be removable so I am going to use some construction glue and put it back together. (gorilla super glue won't do it)  He will try to chew on the round ends and that is when it gets taken away.  You have to screw it together firmly and monitor them while they play.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Got it for the cat and she doesn't really get it, though she uses many other food toys. It definitely doesn't hold a cup of food as advertised, so I am unlikely to use it for the dogs. If it came bigger, I would get it for my 40lb dogs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 6 yr old Aussie-dor had it in pieces the 2nd day. He had fun while he had it.

In the Mini Mover the orange cones sit in much deeper holes, so they aren't very easy to just knock out.

Designed especially for medium to large dogs, this interactive dog toy launches the ball for you! It’s perfect for when you’re away or busy doing other things—like getting his dinner ready—while ensuring he gets all the mental and physical exercise that he needs. All you have to do is plug it in, choose your launching distance and then drop in a tennis ball.

It's almost like it gets tired...even when plugged in.  It will launch the ball 40' 5 or 6 times and then the distance gets shorter and shorter until it's just launching 2-3' over and over.   My dog is a dachshund, so there isn't a whole lot of slobber keeping the ball from launching.   This happens even if I put a new ball in it after the first 5-6 launches.  

This toy keeps my dog really happy when it works but I can never leave it out for my dog to use without supervision because when the ball gets stuck inside/won't launch it makes her crazy.  I might was well just be throwing the ball myself.  For the price I would</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this Dec 30 , 2018 .  Today I’d Oct. 1 2020.  It was the center of my dogs world ! He wore it out today , it tosses the ball about 6” on the highest setting .  Is it worth $100.00 a year ? Raz would bark yes...  me..... I just wish it lasted longer.  He’s worth buying another one for .</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Didn't launch nearly as far as advertised, and the balls got stuck after two or three throws, every time. Complete waste of money</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought racquetballs to replace the tennis balls, after reading reviews &amp; knowing how our dog likes to destroy fuzzy tennis balls.  
Still working on him dropping the ball into the launcher on his own, but we are training in increments:  bring the ball to the launcher, nudge the ball out of my hand into the launcher, and [hopefully soon] dropping it in himself.
He understands that this device will throw the balls for him, and he keeps trying to bark at it or stick his nose in the holes.
It stays powered on if plugged in, but seems to go to sleep to save energy.  Wakes up if a ball is dropped in.  The lowest setting works well in our apartment, but we need to make sure it isn't aimed towards</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is enjoying the toy. It's a great idea, but my biggest problem is just the quality of the device and the balls. The first time we were using it on the 10, the ball would get stuck inside. I bumped it up to the next level and that seemed to help, but my dog already destroyed 2 of the 3 balls. Lucky I ordered a second set (which still hasn't arrived even though I ordered it a week ago....) But I will not buy any more ifetch balls.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I  about love chewy. They are fast and their products are great. I do have a issue with the product that I recently purchased. This is a manufacturer’s issue not chewy. I brought a ball launcher for my dog and some pieces fall off. This happens when my dog pushes it . Top ring and ring where ball shoots out falls off a lot. Other than that it’s good.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this product and it only worked one time. I have a very disappointed Boston Terrier. Had to return the item. They promised me another one and then told me it was not in stock anymore. Very disappointed</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Did not work last year for a Christmas present so I returned it.  Bought it again this year, didn't work this year either</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a great product but it just doesn't shoot far enough for my Border Collie. She will drop the balls in and watch it shoot but it doesn't launch high enough to catch. She prefers the Nerf gun.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’m very disappointed in this product. It barely tosses the ball no matter which setting</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/ifetch-too-automatic-ball-launcher/dp/142436,automatic ball launchers,interactive toys

I live in an apartment so this has been a fantastic purchase entirely worth every penny.  Libs was skittish at first and I had to coach her a little bit...she almost ran and jumped out the window she was so scared.  But no...I saved her.  It only took that initial 1st time, and now...4 weeks later she loves it.   15 minutes is about what it takes her to dig and finish.  Good mental stimulation.  Easy to fold up and store/wash.  The material is durable. 
 We've used it about 15 times, washed it once.  Looks brand new.  Will be fantastic for a Minnesota winter.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">For a few months, I debated getting this for her.  It’s the price.  No dog needs this, but she sure enjoyed it. She’s getting really good at feeder toys and puzzles. This one is different in that she has to dig down and into the layers to get the food. I used her kibble and some freeze-dried chicken. She loved it. Each layer has a pocket to stuff treats, food, or toys in. The paw print on top is actually 2 pockets. One of the layers has a mesh insert.  This toy kept her occupied for much longer than her snuggle mat.  I still recommend supervising the pups while they find all of the goodies. I got this one because it folds up. To me, it’s good for those of us who don’t have a lot of storage space</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/ifetch-idig-go-dog-toy-blue/dp/239829,automatic ball launchers,interactive toys
