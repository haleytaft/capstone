It is a tough toy, but maybe too tough because she quickly lost interest.  It may be because my dog is also older and her gums could be too sensitive.  For young puppies, I can see that this would keep them entertained and it will last much longer than most plushies.  For older, picky dogs like mine, I will need to find something else.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this as a soft cuddly toy for our new miniature schnauzer puppy. She loves it! She cuddles it while napping, but it's also sturdy enough for chewing and active puppy play. There are lots of places to grab onto - legs, tail, antlers. It also has a squeaker in it, which she loves, though she is not yet big enough to squeak it herself.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The toys I have purchased last longer than others.  My dog finds the squeaker and tears it out and proceeds to unstuff  her toys,  but the bear I purchased and this moose she has not destroyed.  Now when we play she always goes and finds her Moose to play with she may bring others to start, but always finds her Moose.  I recommend Chewy toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pit mix received this for her birthday. I expected it to last a day or two but it’s been about a month and is still in one piece. She’s a rough player and super chewer and only one seam is starting to show wear (easy fix). I’m impressed and this Kong moose is living up to his brand</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy has held up fairly well with our border collie. He loves to throw it around the living room and it is the perfect size for him. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the seem on the belly is starting to come loose but that is expected with how rough our dog is. For a cheap toy it has lasted more than most.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I LOVE this toy and so does redick! Red has a gold medal in destroying plush toys. However he LOVES them. He always has a favorite that we refer to as ""his baby!"" This is his new baby and he has managed to not ruin it!!!!! A friend of mine got one for her lab and he is the same way with it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a border collie puppy only 10 weeks old - so a little guy. Chewed through this toy in a week. Kong brand claims tough toys that will last and they should given their price! If a 10 week old collie can chew through a toy in a week it’s not a tough toy. Our pups are supervised unless in their crates, this is not negligence on our part. This is a mis represented product. Very disappointed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a German Shepherd and I bought him this moose. He LOVES his moose. He isn’t a big chewer but nibbles it occasionally. He carries it around with him all over. Still in good condition after a month of carrying it everywhere and lightly chewing on it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog was so happy to get a new toy. Her first kong toy has lasted her a year before it ripped. Today I received the Melvin Moose kong toy and just after a few hours of playing with it. It ripped and my back yard now is full of stuffing. Can’t believe I paid that money for this to rip so fast , and now I have to removed my little babies new toy from her</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I don’t expect any chew toy to stand up to my heavy chewing young adult Staffordshire mix, but this toy has lasted 4 months and counting, which is a first and only... none of the other Brand plushes I bought at the same time lasted a month, and this is one of her most played-with and mouthed.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys

One of our favorite Kong products, hands down.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Hello my name is Nuka my mission in life is to get the Squeaker And fluff out of every toy. Kong said I couldn’t do it with this one. Mommy read the reviews that it would last.....while I said hold my beer...wait I am only 2 and I am a dog!!!!! How about hold my bone! When this cutie showed up in the mail just 24 hours ago I knew what I had to do. Within 24 hours I had completed my mission and removed the squeaker. Now as we speak I am working on the moose. No fluffer is safe as long as I am around. Sure this one took slightly more effort then most but I am strong, tough and ready to defluff! 


Message from a human. Though it was cute it just didn’t last. :-( we will let her play with it for</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have 2 aggressive chewers that destroy stuffed toys usually in a day or minutes sometimes but love them. I don't buy them often for that reason. But these blue dogs have held up for 2 weeks so far and were on sale.(the reason I tried them). They still have stuffing and all their limbs...lol....I even washed and dried them yesterday. I will definitely buy again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 1yr old Bernedoodle loved the Blue Dog. He played with it immediately and within a few hours the stitching began to come apart. Soon after....the stuffing was flying everywhere. I removed the stuffing from Blue dog and my doddle played with the toy for several more hours until it was completely ripped. Blue dog was quickly thrown in the trash. Don’t waste your money. Kong is overhyped and overpriced!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My nearly 3 year old Goldendoodle LOVES this toy! He usually destroys toys but he has not opened this one up yet. He loves to play fetch with it and rough-house with it. He did chew off the ears and the tail. Nothing major, but if you have a strong chewer, I would watch if they focus on those parts for a while.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I read the reviews and it seemed perfect for my dog. When I gave it to her she absolutely loved it. She was walking around with it in her mouth. Then she destroyed it and got the squeaker out in not even an hour. It was a good toy while it lasted though! She loves toys that squeak</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Diamond has only played with her hedgehog until Mr. Blue came along, and now she loves both of her favorite toys. I wanted to call it Blue Dog because that’s what my sweet Jeb called his favorite toy, but when I say Blue Dog, Diamond runs to the door looking for a dog! Silly girl!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pug was depressed! She looks like a prize pig so the vet put his foot down and put her on diet. :(  she laid around the house with no zip.  That is until this guy showed up.  She has her spark back.

It was bigger, more sturdy, and the ropes were harder. Stiff to be exact. It was our favorite rope toy and it lasted the longest of all her toys. And she is a pretty aggressive chewer. The monkey itself is about half the size of the one we had before. 
The new one is smaller, softer and the ropes aren’t as stiff. Pretty disappointed it wasn’t like the one we had before. Gonna give it a try and see how long it lasts before it’s torn apart.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this and as as soon as I got it out the box my dog LOVED it. She usually does not play by her self with toys but this one made her entertain herself for at least 5 minutes. I was impressed and this seems to feel like it’ll last a long time so no problem there.

The squeakers and some stuffing are ripped out right away, but tough quilted thick material, ropes are tough, lasts for shaking or playing pulley for a few days afterward!  Also fast next day shipping to the jersey shore.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was afraid this toy I ordered for my dog (a miniature dachshund) would be too big, but she loves it, I think she's teething and she chews on the ropes constantly. When we pay fetch, she manages to carry it back to me without any trouble in spite of it's size. I highly recommend it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Durable but my dog isn't a fan. I placed an order of 6 toys from Chewy and this one was her least favorite. Surprised me because she loves tug o war! Its holding up better than others but perhaps because its played with less? I'm happy with it. Too bad my pooch isn't lol</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought several of these plush-in-the-middle tug toys. This one was the only one that my two (8# and 10#) dogs enjoyed. I'm going to return the others (too big for little mouths to carry) and replace with more Frisco toys to hold in reserve.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bandit, my little Staffy/pit mix is just not into ""fetch"", no matter how hard I try.... but he love-love-loves tug of war with his ""munkey"" and even sleeps with it!  He loves it so much that he has to show it to me as soon as I get home! :-)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It is perfect for an exuberant pet, except for the hard part in the head.  I am sure it is a necessary part to get some distance when it is thrown. but our dog is hesitant.  It is well made and I like squeaking it.  Maybe it was meant for me.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 7 month old puppy loves the stuffed rope toys. Typically they last him for several weeks, sometimes more. This one, by Frisco, was destroyed in 15 minutes. The ropes were shredded, which is usually what lasts. Longer than the stuffed parts. Very disappointed. We will stick to Kong toys from now on. They last a really long time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">She LOVES the monkey! Multi-purpose toy to play tug of war or fetch or just carry it around with her.

I’d heard awesome things about this toy. The material is a little on the thinner side but the ropes seem very durable. There’s two decent sized squeakers in the toy. She likes it I just wish she’d play with it more but that’s not the products fault. The reason I’m giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it’s not as thick as it come off to be.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our pup loves these toys. She’s had the bunny, the fox, the elephant... I can’t keep up. The fabric holds up fairly well and my husband and I appreciate the fact that there’s not a ridiculous amount of stuffing inside. The inner knots really extend the life of this toy but after a couple months it‘s time for a replacement.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was our newly adopted 6 year old labs first new toy, she was currently playing with our proir dogs used toys. She was so excited and loved the toy but had the faced or off in approximately 15 minutes. All of the other toys in our house that she has been playing with for the past 2 months this never happened. I don't know if this particular toy had a quality issue or if they are all that way. She is very disappointed that we already have to do surgery on her brand new toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 15 lb. 10 yr. old Jack Russell that destroys stuffed toys in minutes.  I buy them anyway because he has so much fun tearing them apart.  I purchased the Kong Floppy Knots Rabbit and he has been playing with it most of the day and he still hasn't torn it apart.  Each joint has a braided rope in it which prevents him from chewing thru it or tearing it apart.  Doesn't contain much stuffing but still has squeakers in it to tease him.  Great toy and it was on sale!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’ve actually purchased two of these because my dog loves it so much. She destroyed the first one as a young puppy and I thought maybe once her puppy stage was over, she could have another and not destroy it. So wrong. The ear has been chewed off. The little knotted “hands” and “feet” are now strings that I constantly have to cut off or amputate the whole foot. Such a fun toy but not as durable as I need.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My two German Shepherds love this toy and the bunny one, too. They carry them around all the time squeezing the squeakers. When they get stinky, I throw all the Kong toys in the washing machine and air dry them. Washed them several times now and they are still in great shape.  Both my dogs are very excited when the Chewy boxes arrive. They help me open them and always look for the new toys and treats.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My girl tends to tear through her stuffed squeaky toys in under 30 minutes. I ordered Bunny and Fox hoping they'd last past unboxing. Well, it's 4 days later, and while they both have been slobbered on and slept with, they are both very much in tact. After the first day of apprehension, my 70lb aggressive chewer has played tug of war, made me chase her to get them, and has worn herself out playing on her own. I haven't tested them outside, because I live in FL and it's pretty mucky this time of year, but I would highly recommended either toy for bully breeds.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">LoL this morning we found him in the living room with his toy , on the floor with strings of fabric everywhere. We usually leave him with toys we deem safe for him to be alone with, we're helicopter parents since he is still a pup, and we didn't think we'd say goodbye to this toy so soon. It seemed really sturdy and the fabric is tightly woven but his puppy teeth were too much for him. I had high hopes because the fabric felt really strong and it's from Kong so I thought it was gonna last more than a month since he has other toys but nah. It's good for a dog that mildly bites though, I guess ..</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My chihuahua loves to chew. His favorite thing is to just gnaw on his toys and try to pick them apart. He chews threw a normal stuffed toy in about a week, but this toy is his favorite and still going strong after 3 months! He chewed the ears off pretty quickly, but the rest of the toy is still holding up well to everyday chewing (and attempts to pick apart). 

My dog is pretty small, but I think this toy could hold its own against bigger dogs as well. The outside is kind of like terry cloth and canvas, with cotton rope at the ends, the inside feels like it is also rope (no stuffing!) and there are squeakers in the head and belly.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Even though this toy did not last as long as I hoped, it was still a great buy and I will be purchasing more to keep on hand for when my dog inevitably destroys the one she has now. It's great for tug as well as solo play where she can just gnaw on the ropes on her own. She also loves pulling apart stuffed toys and getting the squeaker out, so if your dog is like that too then they'll definitely enjoy this toy. All in all it keeps her occupied and that's all I can really ask for!</span>]",stuffed,plush toys

For my girl, Lambchop is never that far away.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I purchased 2 mini versions of lamby for my 3lb Morkie prior to his arrival. He fell in love. I had accidentally bought 2..Thank God. My little guy had no interest at first in any other toy. Lamby ruled and for 3-4 lbs he got those squeekies out after about a month. Best part, he's still obsessed with them having no squeeky. I ordered 3 more. Got 3 regular by mistake. He just does not have the interest like the minis. I wish I could find the minis again. Why did they stop selling them?? Please bring the minis back.

We have a puppy and he destroyed this less than 12 hours after getting it (and he slept about 10 of the hours in between) not at all sturdy.  He is not destructive with toys but the seams on this are just very poorly made.

I've also bought this from the pet store numerous times for the dogs that I have watched/sat.  I've yet to meet a pup who didn't love their little Lamb-y Chop!  The squeaker is also perfect for re-directing a dog - especially when they are toy oriented.  It gets their attention real quick.

Octopus toys are a favorite for my two dogs, but I’m beginning to think that they aren’t for chewers, or for play tugging at all.  I have yet to find one that can withstand that sort of play.  Little 20 lb dog did like holding this and shaking it like she was trying to “kill” it.  If she was the only one who got to play with it, I suspect it would have been just fine.  Bigger 65 lb dog pulled it apart.  Oh well, they had fun with it while it lasted!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My ""power chewer"" aussie mix ripped a hole in the top of its head within about one minute, so I'm disappointed in that it didn't last nearly as long as his last Kong stuffed toy (the t-rex from the dinosaur set), although maybe his chewing has leveled up since then. I'm just going to pull out the body stuffing and give it back to him though, he loves all of the legs and will definitely still have fun with it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Another great toy by Kong! We first purchased the whale in the same line of toys and she loved it so much that I quickly ordered this octopus too. It’s a smaller toy than the whale, but Koda actually seems to prefer that. She’s a 50 lb staffy mix but she seems to gravitate towards smallish/medium sized stuffies. The thick corduroy-like material Is great. 100% recommend, but I will admit she doesn’t really tear into and destroy her toys... she’s a weirdo and  lays down and systematically nibbles off little pieces.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the second time I've purchased the KONG Octopus toy for my dog. The head/body has a squeaker in it and each leg/arm makes the crinkle sound. It's a great toy to throw or to play tug with. I love that it has multiple legs so that I can grab on and not have to get too close to my pup's teeth! It's quite durable as well. My 3 year old beagle is a master at destroying toys and this little octopus is still in one piece after a couple of weeks.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog, which is a chewer but not a destructive, shredding everything puppy, ripped a hole in it, pulled the guts out.

These toys are for Chihuahuas.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I had bought the whale from Kong and decided to buy the octopus right along with it. She likes it!!!

With this background I'm continuously shocked when he finds one of these guys and brings it to me in his giant maw begging for me to throw it or give chase. It's been 4 months.

I thought about it and realized the yorkiepoo might like it because she enjoys digging through her toy box to find her favorite one. They do enjoy soft, squeaky toys so I knew the dinos alone would spark their interest. But they honestly love this whole toy! Surprisingly, even our oldest yorkie loves it and we weren’t sure if she would. She was digging at it like crazy trying to figure out how to get those dinos out! The funniest thing was the holes are just big enough for her to get her head stuck in. We got a couple hilarious videos of this because she did it twice!

You can't get a better review than that.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It is very difficult to find a toy that our Belgian malinois shepherd won't destroy in 5 minutes. To say she's an aggressive chewer is an understatement...and I was aware that this specifically said NOT for aggressive chewers.

She loves to play hide-n-seek with her ball amongst old towels, so I thought we'd give it a shot. SO glad we did!  She went nuts over it!  She did eventually de-squeaked the squeakers in all but one of the baby dinos, so far, but it took awhile, which we were surprised and pleased. She still enjoys chewy on the dinos a lot, even though they don't squeak - go figure!  </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Okay so I am currently stuck at home in quarantine so I am taking advantage and catching up on school work for my MSW program, my pup is also recovering from his neuter and is driving me BANANAS!!

The area around the holes has a few nibble marks already, but this toy will still provide plenty of entertainment for time to come. My dog is able to remove the dinos pretty quickly, but continues to play with it after all the toys are refilled again. I'm sure if I left her alone with it she would rip apart, but working from home it helps to keep her distracted and I just replace the dinos after she's finished removing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’ve been looking for toys to entertain my dog while we’re working from home and THIS IS IT! He loves being able to hunt and ‘dig’ a bit to find the dinosaurs. They’re a perfect size for him too. After a couple rounds of finding dinos he’s surprisingly tired out. So happy with this purchase!!! @jerrytherealfancyboy approved!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our three month old pup loves this. She can chew on the volcano, the dinosaurs, and she is slowly figuring out how to pull them out which makes it great for puppy mental stimulation.

My bigger dog loved this skunk so much that I ordered the fox.  Upon arrival the fox was deemed an intruder and destroyed on site.  Yet, a week later, the skunk is now part of dailey yard recon duty.  I've included pictures of the watch as well as the assigned 10 minute break.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this skunk because Sam has been having some skin issues and I felt like she needed some cheering up. (I was actually on here to order her itch stuff). Well, in about 3 hours Sammi was crying. She done ate a leg off her skunk and felt bad  (I'm assuming). There's 1 leg she done took off completely,  the other leg and arm is just about off, as is an ear.
She likes to nawl on her babies, and this is one of her favorites.

I decided to try this bear out because of the inner rope and “minimal” stuffing, however this bear did not last longer than a week and a half. He chewed off most of the bear’s limbs and I felt like there is way more than minimal stuffing because every time I turned around I was picking up clumps everywhere. He did love this toy and it was very cute seeing him run around with it but I would not get it for him again. Also the rope inside of it isn’t very durable either and just shreds a lot.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy seems indestructible!!! Probably why she doesn't play with it unless I engage with her. Because she is bit of a chewer most toys don't last within a day of play. It seems to be her mission in life to obliterate toys.

Unfortunately, the ball didn't last too long once he found the ""weak spot"" and tore a hole in it, but so far the other 2 toys are holding up well. I put a few of his other favorite toys in the ""box"" and he has a great time pulling them all out. It's been a great mid-afternoon distraction for him as we're winding down our day from our new normal of me working from home! Chewy is absolutely the BEST EVER go-to for anything. I've referred everyone I know to this amazing company with the BEST customer service  ALL THE TIME!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I am aware that no dog toy is totally chew proof but I had hoped this would last more than 10 minutes!  I bought five Frisco brand toys for our 7 month old puppy and he was able to destroy every one of them.  I would not recommend purchasing any toys from the Frisco line.  I contacted customer service two weeks ago and never heard back from them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our boxer puppy absolutely loves this toy!  We have had it for a while now, and it is one of her favorites!  The soft box, rope, squeaky bone, and ball are all well made and have not ripped or torn at all.  She plays with it a lot, and it helps to give her something to do with all of her energy!  She loves to stick her whole nose in one of the holes on the box and get the toys inside!  Trust me, she isn't easy on it either!  We are so happy with our purchase and would recommend to anyone with a playful pup!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a super affordable and versatile puzzle toy! My 3 month old, 5 lb Frenchie puppy really likes it. You can use the toys that come with it or you can hide other toys in there too. Sometimes I hide treats or chews in there. My Frenchie also really likes to nap ON TOP of the toy box for some reason... don't ask me why... I guess it's an added bonus lol!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We rescued our 16 lb JRT Abby who is 6 years old but seems to have never played with dog toys before (she will only go for cat toys) so I went out on a limb with this but she loves it! I’ve also made it a fun toy for when I leave by stuffing other things like treats and bones in there for when I leave so it makes her keep coming back to dig them out.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a great product! My dog loves playing with these toys! I wouldn't say she really plays the whole, 'Hide and Seek' part of the toy, but it's great for storing the toys. She especially loves the bone! It's her new favorite toy! If needed, I would totally buy another one! It is at a great price for everything included. I would totally recommend this product to anyone with a playful pup!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My puppy loves to pull all the toys out of this fabric box! She especially loves the squeaky ball. We stuff various toys/balls/treats into the box and watch her ""hunt"". Unfortunately she discovered a tag inside (her favorite thing to chew) and before I realized it she had chewed a small hole in the box. But it still works, we just have to supervise her more during ""hunting"".</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I saw this while looking through the variety of toys and immediately knew our Great Dane had to have it! She eagerly awaits the mail man on delivery day; when she sees that blue and brown box she KNOWS it's hers! 

Obviously this toy is on the smaller side for her, but she loves it anyway. The moment I hide the included toys in the plush box she grabs them all right back out. She would do it for hours, if we let her! When she ""finds"" a toy inside, she prances around the house with it in her mouth to show off her prize.

Highly recommended for the fur babies who wait for those Chewy boxes to arrive!</span>]",stuffed,plush toys

She likes to hold one end while we hold the other to play or she'll even swing it around. It has multiple squeakers so I can squeak it while she squeaks the other end to spur her on during play. When she's tired, she likes to chew on the sloth's arms and legs. Overall, a great buy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Adorable and very durable. I buy Frisco toys all the time now because they're the only ones our dog doesn't wreck in minutes!

Needless to say, the hedgehogs didnt stay in very well and she was able to get all three out in a matter of minutes and she has already destroyed one, likely would be two if I hadn't put the remaining two back in the den.

For months she showed no interest in toys... until ""Mr. Fox"". It is a great shape and texture for tug or indoor fetch. It is now my dogs absolute favorite thing and she loves it so much we bought 3 backup. She carries him around with her everywhere and occasionally he sleeps in her bed.  She plays with many toys now but Mr. fox is still her favorite!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Good size for a 50-60 lb dog.  Lasts a few days with my pitbull.  I mean the squeakers and some stuffing are ripped out right away, but good for shaking or playing pulley for a few days afterward!  Also fast next day shipping to the jersey shore.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I purchased this fox in April when we brought him home. We’ve gone through several stuffed toys, all to which have met their demise within a day. But not Mr. Fox. He has held on strong without a single tear to patch up.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">All three of my dogs are at different stages in their lives, and they all enjoy playing with this fox.  It is first pick of all their many toys.  They compete to see who can get to it first.  The 4 month old kitten even drags it around when the dogs don't have it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the first toy I introduced to my pup when he came home. It was love at first squeak. Then we found out Bennet is a chewer. And a really good one too. But Mr. Fox is tough and strong and not a single scratch. He still looks brand new and goes everywhere with Bennet even though they’re almost the same length.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">my new pomsky loves this toy. it has two squeakers in it that are different sounds which is great for getting her attention.  She is however, an aggressive chewer but this toy has held up so well.  It is bigger than I thought (twice the size of my puppy) however she just loves it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We are still trying to decide if she likes her new fox or not. Just kidding, our little Shih Tzu absolutely loves Foxy! She will carry it around the house and loves to play tug a war. I could share many pictures, but decided on this one. Don't hesitate to get this plush toy for your fur baby!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Quickly nicknamed Felix by the family, (we name all our dog stuffies) this Fox is super soft, well made, and has a squeaker in both the body and the tail, which sounds very much like fox barks. It is our Aspen June's (1 yr old Pitsky) favorite of the 5 toys we bought her!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My puppy is a chewer so some toys tend to not hold up well. This one has definitely held up longer than most by months. They main squeaker in the body is easy to squeak and she hasn't dug it out. She did eat some of the limbs off her first one but it still remained a favorite. When I got her a new one, she was so happy that she wouldn't put it down unless she was eating or going outside.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">5 stars for the love my 5 months old doberman had for this toy...for about 1.5 days. He took off all the legs and de-stuffed it. Not for powerful chewers.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys

Even my hound mix is playing with it and he NEVER plays with toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The dogs love this toy. I have three labs and a pitt mix. We have had it for two weeks now and it doesn’t even have a hole! It’s a good size. The size of a football. The fins have a crinkle noise and it has one squeaky in the body of the whale. It is white so it has gotten pretty dirty so if your weird about that then don’t get this toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was quite surprised by my purchase. My dog loves carrying this toy around by his tail. We ordered the medium and it is a good size for my Goldendoodle. The material is very sturdy and very colorful.
The only issue is only one squeaker and its in the main body, I recommend putting one or two in the tail.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I thought this whale was super cute, but didn’t take long for my puppy to chew off the fins and then a hole in the body.  For Kong I expected something more durable and that would last longer. Only a week before we had to throw it away. If you have a chewer,  probably should avoid. His Godog toys lasted much longer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is really cute and well-made. I believe it's worth the money, however, my puppy is a very strong chewer and she had the seam ripped open in no time.  She does this with most toys so I wasn't really surprised.  If your dog isn't destructive,  I would recommend this</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Very cute and super durable! I have a major chewer and this toy has outlasted most others.

My Corgi is a chewer and he tore through this toy with the first two hours.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We love Kong toys in our house.

It is not very durable.The stuffing is encased a thin sheet of plastic.  He was not very happy when I had to take it away.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Sadly, this did not work out for my pups. Within 5 minutes of taking it out of the box, it was ripped open with stuffing everywhere. I was hoping with the size of this toy that it would have held up longer but the material is extremely thin.

One last thing I ordered the small one as I have chihuahuas and it is small but perfect for their little mouths.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pomeranian Sophie Pearl loved this toy. Unfortunately she loved it to DEATH. Like it  took only  one day of play for ""green Dog"" to meet his demise. Sophie Pearls expertise is finding stuffed toys vulnerable weak spots and exploiting until she reaches stuffing. Thats why i only give her toys when i can observe her.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Papillon has two of these and she loves them so much they got filthy.  When I washed them there was an ear that came off in the dryer.  I don't know why that freaked me out, but it did.  I was going to throw it away, but my pup caught me with it and I felt bad so I sewed the ear back on.  Will use a lingerie bag next time I launder.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Over the years all of our dogs have loved Loofas.  Our current boy is no exception.  He grabs the Loofa in the middle, swings it around &amp; throws it.  Then gets to work finding &amp; systematically removing the squeakers.  Once successful, he lays down &amp; pulls out the stuffing.  This keeps him happy &amp; busy for a good half hour or more.  A big mess?  Yes.  Barney happy?  Priceless.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We ordered the large and were surprised by how long it was; but such fun for the two pups who spent big chunks of time playing with one another. Great value for wearing them out &amp; watching the fun unfold!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Tiny squeeky toy. Cheaply made. Lasted less than an hour and she wasnt even rough with it. Lost interest quick because its a stuffed animal with a quarter size squeeker in it.

He’s started to “assert his dominance” onto it which we think is really funny, but don’t want to encourage that behavior so we have to take it away from time to time!

We used the heating pads for a few days (they really heat up nicely) but now she’s comfortable with just the heartbeat.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Since the first day we brought Crosby home at 8 weeks old, this has been his favorite.  Because it's his favorite, he wears them out and we have to get replacements.  I always take a piece off of his old puppy and put it in the velcro pocket where the heart goes so it still smells like his puppy.  I couldn't believe this came as a 2 pack - and for the same price as a single anywhere else!!  The second one is currently in a zip-lock baggy with old puppy so it will smell great when we have to replace again.  Thank you for keeping Crosby supplied - at a reasonable price!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We just received a brand new 8 week old puppy. She was so scared. The sound of the beating heart seemed to comfort her along with us laying right next to the crate. The added benefit was the light sound of the heartbeat allowed us to sneak into our bed and get some shut eye for a few hours.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This isn't my first rodeo.  I HAVE RAISED MANY puppies. I crate train them all.  Being that we are moving and I have been a little stressed I wanted this particular pup to have it all and not be.  Brought her home at 8 weeks and she snuggled right up to it in her crate. She is now 11 weeks and still sleeps with it.  I noticed from the get go that she loved the size and the heartbeat.  Just get it. I promise the pup will love it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Unlike a lot of reviewers, my rescue pup is not a puppy at all, but a 7 year old mini poodle. She is quite timid and anxious about being alone, which made crate training (at night, in our bedroom) very noisy from her barks and howls. Today, I put the puppy with the heartbeat (no heat pad) in the crate while she was barking, and she IMMEDIATELY calmed down. This is only the first night, but I’m very hopeful she won’t feel so scared or upset in her crate!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This purchase was worth every penny. I got my yorkie puppy 2 weeks ago, she was 10 weeks old. From the first night and every night after she has slept through the night. She sleeps in a pack and play play pen . Sometimes she’s snuggled right up to it, other nights I see her not too far away. It’s worth it !!!</span>]",stuffed,plush toys

It was tough getting him to learn 'human play' and not to bite on my arms because he was so used to playing with other dogs without toys etc. I could not get him to use toys, especially squeakers, but as soon as I gave him this one, he fell in love! Its now his favorite toy and he cant stop squeaking it! Its sturdy enough for medium chewers due to its hollow  core (I wouldnt give it to a pit, german shepherd, or golden) and the the fur sometimes gets ripped off easily. But I cant complain! This toy is awesome.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought this opossum toy for our hound mix, who loves furry, squeaky toys, and it immediately made the list of house favorites for all 3 of our dogs. 

I highly recommend this if you have a dog that likes squeakers - the entire body is filled with them, including ones that make sounds when the toy is shaken. 
Our dogs normally play with a toy for a few days, and then begin destroying it. We've had this for several weeks now, and it's still intact, which is a testament to how much our dogs love making it squeak. 

The only con with this toy is that it can be noisy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My husky typically destroys any toy in about 20 minutes, meaning the squeaker is either out or crunched so much that it doesn't squeak and she loses interest. The squeaker inside makes up the ""body"" of the toy with only a layer of ""fur"" outside, no stuffing. She got this guy last night after dinner. It lasted a good hour of constant chewing (squeaking). She managed to chew his nose off and put a hole in his head, but she was still playing with him this morning and while he doesn't make as much noise as yesterday, he still squeaks! I have to order a couple more! I only wish he was a little bigger, but it was a good value.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs are tough on toys but prefer the soft rugged ones so that’s what I buy them. I was doubting my purchase a little when it arrived so real looking because we live in the woods and odds are we will come across an opossum. I didn’t want them to think it’s a chew toy. However they loved this thing. They immediately ripped its guts and squeaker out which is par for the course. They still drag its little Body around and tease each other with it, which is creepy but not a knock on the toy. They were happy so I’m happy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These are absolutely awesome. The dogs love them and I laugh at the messy bed head fur on these toys. Whoever created them knows opossums! They are hilarious to look at and just adorable. My house mate asked me if I got them for the dogs or for me! Haha But enough about that! The dogs love them. They were an instant favorite. They have a bottle crinkle body which I didn’t expect. Two of my dogs aren’t into the bottle crunch sound typically but this one isn’t too squishy so the crunch sounds isn’t too loud like some so all my dogs are really enjoying them!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My doodles love their Opossum babies. They are sturdy, great for their tug-o-war playing, fetch, and chew. Normal plush toys fall apart after hours (if not minutes of play), but these Opossums have held up for the past 2 weeks and are still holding strong! For some reason, this is their favorite toy. I hope it's never discontinued!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy was Radar’s favorite present that he received for his 15th birthday! There’s 3 large squeakers in the toy that all seem to be connected into one big mega squeaker and they’re pretty loud, which is perfect for my hard-of-hearing senior pup! The toy seems to be well made and durable. Highly recommend!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this for my 9month old Siberian. He is typical Sibe - we call him Arlo The Terrible or Arlo The Siberian Tornado LoL. He ADORED it! I did make the mistake of getting a medium, so sadly, Mr O was decapitated in about 30 minutes. Had to laugh, I walked in the living room and there on my sofa seat was Mr I’d head. Gave a real Godfather vibe LOL. The headless body is still a favorite outdoor furry. 

I am getting the bigger version and he will be thrilled! He loves it so much and Mr O #2 will be bigger and hopefully keep his head.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs absolutely love this thing.  They pack it around like a little baby and cuddle it all the time.  When they are feeling a little feisty they will nibble at it and they love the sound it makes. It has been pretty durable so far too.  I’m going to buy another one for them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My boxer recently caught a squirrel an brought it inside to his dog bed in living room I bought this a couple weeks later when my daughter came home from work she about jumped out of her skin cause the dog had it in his mouth hahaha we got a good laugh and the dogs 2 male boxers and   A jack russel  Mixed little girl absolutely love playing with this toy and it’s got a very loud squeaker in the an my boys got it out in the first 3 days even with us putting it up occasionally but they still love it without it squeaking it was totally worth the price !!!</span>]",stuffed,plush toys

She had multiple holes in it as well.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog destroys almost all of her plushie type toys.  Before this toy, no toy had made it longer than 2 days.  We're on almost 2 weeks and it's still in tact.  She absolutely loves it!  Not 5 stars because she does pull at the fuzzy fur and it cones off.  Despite that, there's  no hole!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’m on my 3rd one of these balls in 2 years. I wish they were stronger for determined chewers, but my golden hardly ever puts it down. It’s the toy she takes with her to bed each night.

We tried this and he's had it 2 weeks now and still hasn't got the squeaky out and only managed to bite his nose off !!  But the great thing, he walks around with it in his mouth like it's his baby and if one of us tries to move it, he's there to make sure we don't 'hurt' it or take it away.  Even takes it to bed with him !!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog Dreidel loves her wolf.  She sleeps with it and she chews it.  I really didn't think it would last much longer then a day however she has had it for to weeks now and it is like new.  This is  the first soft toy my furbaby hasn't destroyed within 2 days.  Both owner and doggie very happy with purchase.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys

Great, toy that involves some activity and thinking.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We purchased the Volcano Puzzle Dog Toy for our puppy Loki. He loved his toy and figuring out how to get to the dinosaurs inside. This is his second set of these guys and he was super excited to see them inside his volcano again. Of course he chews on them and eventually they go “extinct” but we can easily replace them for his enjoyment.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought our 8yr old beagle, Jack, the Volcano and Dinosaurs puzzle to celebrate our 22 yr Anniversary. Jack can be a powerful chewer at times but he seems to take extra care when he plays with his puzzles. Jack will remove a squeaker from 1 or 2 of the dinosaurs and then leave the rest alone because he likes them to squeak. Make sure to supervise your babies.  We play hideaway with Jack and his puzzles and we tug with the puzzle pieces or throw the pieces for him to catch;he loves all that.  After awhile, Jack will walk away and play with something else but a day later he always comes back and plays again.  It's a great toy and we are glad our beagles love it. Thanks again!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My puppy loves these, but probably not as much as I do. Recently discovered how silly she is when she wakes up surrounded by these dinosaurs! She’s chewed through 3 of the 9 I’ve bought her, totally worth the price.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 5 year old pitbull mix is known to absolutely destroy tennis balls in 5 minutes or less and DEMOLISHED the Kong balls I got for her in 20 minutes total BUT these little plush Dino's have lasted FOUR HOURS so far and none of them have so much as Knick in them. Even if they do all get destroyed eventually, any toy that can withstand her powerful af pitty jaw and her pure determination to WRECK toys has my seal of approval</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves Dinosaurs. He knows names of his toys so we named them Dino. Problem is the squeaker didn’t last but a couple days! Says refills but I don’t see any Velcro. I thought refills meant it was able to have a new squeaker put in like the little bear. A little disappointed on that.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">They are really cute and Riley loves them.  We didn’t get the volcano with them since we have a bird house and squirrel tree to hide them in.  They fit no problem.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Cooper, our three year old Cocker Spaniel, simply destroys his toys. He is particularly fond of any soft toy with a squeaker, and will literally rip toys apart until he gets to the squeaker part. (Even toys that claim to be for power chewers, are indestructible, or have squeakers that keep on squeaking even if popped.) Needless to say, he is NEVER left alone with a squeaker toy, and we go through A LOT of toys. 

So when my daughters wanted to get him these dinosaurs, with the volcano, I was sure they would be ripped apart within minutes. To my surprise they were not! He loves to have us hide the dinos in the volcano, and waits, tail wiggling, until they are all in the volcano and he can pull</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My large dogs love to play with small stuffies. Because they don't tend to last long, I like to find toys that aren't very expensive. Frisco hide and seek refills are perfect. A pack of three for less than 6 dollars is great.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Beagle is a huge chewer. I have been buying every sturdy type game of bone that could endure her chewing. I bought these on a whim because they seemed fun in the volcano - like a game to get them out. He got them out in a heartbeat. The funny part - he carries these around the house like babies. They squeak so we play fetch - he brings to me (but won't let go) - and I throw a different one. He drops the one he has and goes for the next one. I squeak them to get his attention. I always know when he wants to play now - as he brings these to me! The amazing part is that he DOES NOT chew them - go figure!</span>]",stuffed,plush toys

Our dog is a smaller dog and we feel that if a larger dog had got the toy it would have been gone the first day.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a great dane and this is by far his favorite toy, we have to get two a month just to make sure we have them on hand.  Our smaller dog loves them too and he loves to pull out all the different sound makers throughout the hedgehog .  We call the to Henry!! 
Its slightly larger then a football and incredibly soft as well. I 10/10 recommend.
But get the large size!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog came to us with one of these toys, and he had it forever until it was almost falling apart and I had to take it from him for safety reasons.  I was thrilled to see that Chewy had one in a suitable size for him, and I ordered it shortly after.  The dog acts like he's reconnected with a long-lost friend, and is very happy to have it again.  I recommend this toy to other pup parents!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought the large size for my husky mix, and when it arrived I was worried it might be too big for her. It wasn’t though, she immediately loved it! I think it’s one of her favorite toys now. She loves her “hedgie” and sleeps with him most nights. We did have to cut the little felt toes off because she kept trying to chew them off, but that wasn’t really an issue. Great toy as long as you don’t have a heavy chewer!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this hedgehog for my boxer. He loves it! I was impressed how big it is. He has been playing with it for two hours now. He is a heavy chewer and did not chew through yet (I don’t care if he does, it’s his toy after all). Hedgehog has multiple squeakers, at least one squeaky one in the foot. It also has a big squeaker in the body which sounds just like deer grunt call. It is very not-annoying if there is such a thing when it comes to squeakers, haha.
Overall hedgehog looks to be very good quality.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy doesn't last a long time - it's gone within the hour - but the joy Cocoa has as she rips into the body to find the squeaker is fun to watch. She has to be monitored so the squeaker can be retrieved before it becomes small pieces. The squeaker itself is large compared to most other toys. I retrieve the pieces and sew them back together for another fun time or two before I finally throw it away.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys

Flinging Mr. Bill up in the air has become a favorite passtime!  It is SO funny to watch her catch the poor guy ... as she flings him side to side (growling ferociously) he hollers ""oh NOoooooo"", which of course prompts her to toss him again and again!

Pumpkin does tend to pull the stuffing and squeakers out of her cute fluffy toys, but Mr. Bill has not yet met his doom.  He is well-made, his stitching has not come apart, and he tends to show up around the house in odd places, a mere handsome plaything for a growling good time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the second Mr. Bill dog toy I bought. The first one was great, well made, the voice was loud &amp; clear - the neighbors next door could hear it when we were outside. The problem with the first one was that my dog broke the voice box by crushing it during a game of tug, other than that it was sturdy because we put that first one through a lot &amp; it lasted. The voice was his favorite part of the toy so I bought a replacement - I decided we should be more careful with it so it would last even longer, I keep it in a basket I have put up for our special one-on-one playtime sessions together.

Lucy runs away with her's the second she gets ahold of it, so she can slowly destroy it's sweater one string at a time while periodically making it say ""oh no."" Meanwhile, the first time the toy says ""oh no"" Dolly gets so excited that she usually breaks speaker box inside with chomp number one.

He carries it around from room to room.  The price and quality are amazing!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the first dog toy I bought when I adopted Lei Lei.

If I even say ""OHHHHHH NOOOOOOO!  She perks up her ears and looks around.
Pretty cute.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">At first my GSD loved it and technically still does but he managed to open it and take the voice box out from inside which is a hard plastic so i would be cautious of that for anyone looking to purchase. Super interesting toy though!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog Remy, a beagle/sheltie mix was not a dog toy fan, but years ago my sister-in-law got her this Mr. Bill toy....Remy loved it! The ""oh noooooo!"" voice box was so entertaining to her (and for us!).
I was so happy to realize that the Mr. Bill dog toy is still available....I ordered one recently for Remy. I thought it would help her keep occupied now that she cannot walk due to a degenerative spine disease.
When I showed her the toy, she went crazy! Like no time had passed! She loves to chew it and eventually got the ""oh nooooo!"" voice box out. I just stuff it back in. She plays with Mr. Bill even without the voice box....the toy is pretty durable.

She has a history of tearing up her toys quickly but this one is surviving nicely, so far.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My husky likes to pull on the limbs and tail of the toy, but she's not able to get a good squeak out of it. I can make it squeak just fine with my hands but my dog can't seem to get it with her mouth. The squeaker seems to be awkwardly larger and made of a harder material than what's typically in these kind of toys. Maybe it's best for larger dogs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loved this doll while it lasted. Most of her dolls last a year, but unfortunately this one lasted less than that. However, it sure is a really cute doll and my dog did enjoy it very much while it was “alive”!

She enjoyed it so much though that I purchased her a second one to replace the first.  It's pretty common for me to have to frequently replace her toys.  I give this one 3 stars because it lasted longer than some, but not as long as others.  And not as well as I had expected from the Kong brand.  It's just average, but liked enough for a repeat purchase.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Lab puppy loves this toy - it's definitely one of her favorites. It has lots of little chewable extremities like antlers, ears and a tail which she loves to nibble on as well as having a good game of tug-of-war with the rope handles. It has withstood several months of aggressive puppy play. It has also been through the washer a couple of times and washes well. Highly recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought this toy several months ago and put it back for a rainy day. Today, we opened it.

The body is really thick and strong and the ears are even pretty strong. She sometimes looks like she’s trying to tear them off so we redirect her to another part of the toy so it lasts longer and so far so good. She likes to bite on the body as well as the rope part and you also have a rope on the other side to hold onto. Just fair warning- it’s a big, strong, durable toy, yes, but also an ankle killer if your dog likes to shake their toys around!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is one of the 3 toys my dog takes out of the toy bin on a daily basis. It hasn’t been destroyed in over 2 months of playing. I think she likes it because of the squeaker but that there’s not enough stuffing to entice her to tear it apart. She is still working on the tugging part of play but this toy makes for a good cuddle buddy... (P.S. I did not set her up like that! She did it on her own)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This moose very quickly became our 9week old Dachshund's favorite toy to play with. He took to it the day we brought him home.

If you have a chewer, this isn't the best option.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 1 year old 60 lb Bull Terrier LOVES this toy. Kong toys are pretty much the only ones he can’t destroy immediately!  I like the ropes on this toy and it has a squeaker! Great toy! So far holding up well. Will likely be buying another one in future. I like having backups on hand and this is a good one!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I used to think my dog was a destroyer of toys but this toy has lasted through the whole day with nothing taken apart he likes the furry toys but also like playing tug-of-war so this is a 2 in 1 it’s very hard which in my opinion is good less easy to rip apart has lasted a day of pulling as well with no rips or tears from pulling recommend for dogs that love tug-of-war and also playing fetch!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have 3 dogs that will destroy every toy but they loved this they played with it and it lasted longer then I expected.

The dino is a little smaller than I had expected, but it works for us. Love these things.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Both my Yorkie and my Pibble Mix love to chase this toy.  It's wonderful to find a toy that two so vastly size-different dogs can both love.  They play chase and they tug (the Yorkie is a beast and the Pibble is a tender hearted goofball) the toy together.  It's held up very well despite being loved by two dogs.

She loves that she can actually fit it in her mouth. The fabric is super strong. She has ripped up several other stuffed  toys with cheaper fabric. She absolutely loves that she can play rough with her purple dinosaur! She’s also teething so finding toys that will withstand her aggressive chewing is super important for us!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this for my dog when we first got her and she immediately fell in love with this toy. It has been over a year and it is still alive and well. She is obsessed with it: carries it around, grooms it, plays with it- it’s her best friend. I have decided to grab a couple just in case something does happen to this one but the toy quality is amazing, super durable. We’ve bought lots of other GoDog toys since this purchase and are always happy. I’ve noticed people mentioning in comments the small size of the toy - it is perfect for my 7.5 lbs Shorkie :) most toys are usually too big so this is great for us!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">In fairness both dogs still love it, but the puppy has ripped the head and neck off and they have pulled all the fluff out. They now just play with the unstuffed headless body.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This Dino is not only adorable, but another great find with GoDog products! This particular Dino is the SMALL version, best for smaller dogs(and a Siamese  Cat, yes I said it). Since there is a bigger version(size) of this toy make sure you check size beforehand. My mini Dachshunds love this toy, small size fits great in their mouths,durable- great travel toy for on the road moments, this small but mighty Dino has now been in our household since December 2019 and still going squeaking strong especially since I have a master squeaker destroyer! Since it is filled with stuffing we still monitor play, even if our dog does happen to creat a hole and stuffing exposed we simply remove all fluff ,quick</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 7 1/2 week German Shepard is a fan and it’s small enough for him to manage on his own.

Waste of money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This squeaker sounds different than all his other toys and is basically his lovie. Our Havanese carries it around all day if we let him. The first one he had the squeaker broke quickly (lasted a month), but the second one we got is holding up well.

I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it’s very cute and she does really like it even with 3 legs, no squeaker or stuffing, and more holes in it than Swiss cheese.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My almost 5 month old GSD loved this thing, however, he tried to eat the ears and tore the back of the toy apart in less than a day! He loved it though, I wished it lasted longer for him!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my dogs favorite toy! She’s had it since the day we brought her home at 2 months old and she plays with it every day! She absolutely loves it! It is definitely not indestructible but it lasted her longer than any other dog toy we’ve ever purchased! It lasted her entire puppy year and I definitely plan on buying it again to see how long it will last the second go around. I would definitely recommend this toy to all my friends with pups. The squeaker was ripped out within 6 months of having the dragon. I kept the squeaker out and stitched him back up and he was as good as new.

The problem is that he is a skilled surgeon and can get to a squeaker within 5-10 minutes and then pulls stuffing out all over the house leaving a little fragment of fabric. This time however, because of the hard plastic chest, it took him longer to figure out a way to get the squeaker (until day 3). The beauty of it was he had to go thru the shoulder to do it which meant once the squeaker was out he still had an intact tiger except for the shoulder to still play with. He carries it around with him everywhere. A+ for durability for a power chewer!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">this is a really cute toy!  There's only glaring problem..  His ""muscular"" chest is so hard and the squeaky is under the hard plastic chest, so   that unless you're giving this to a Pittie or another muscle dog, your pup may  not be able to play with it as he/she normally would.  
My boy tried.  He ultimately picked it up and put it in his toy box by himself!  
I would certainly not get this for a smaller dog, but a big dog may still have fun with it so I'll still give it a recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I really recommend this toy to anyone. This is our puppy's favorite because of so many reasons. It's large and weighty enough so he can fling it around and release a ton of energy. I personally love this because it keeps himself busy, but when I want to, it's easy to play tug of war with. It has a squeaker (which he can't quite get to yet because his jaw isn't large enough) that easily draws his attention when we squeak it. The plush has a durable liner so it's still in perfect condition despite his destructive tendencies. I have a feeling this is going to be his favorite for a long time, because the abs are made of a tough rubber which he can't grip yet, but will be perfect for when his jaw </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Not only are these toys hilarious, but the rubber abs makes them a bit more resilient. I have a 60 lbs pit mix, and while I’m sure she could probably tear this sucker up if she really wanted to, she has a blast squeaking him and throwing it around the room. Super great, and relatively durable for a plush toy. This toy is her favorite! 10/10 recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our boy Bruno his a Cane Corso just loves these toys he has this one, the lion, rhino and has not tore them up he just sucks on them. Very good quality would recommend this toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog a boxer at first loved this toy. And I appreciated it cause he didn’t tear it up
In 5 minutes. But after a day of having it we noticed white little things coming from it. I don’t know if it was sand/bugs or what but regardless of what it was you don’t want your dog chewing on an item like this.

There is a larger version of the chameleon, which does have stuffing in it to keep shape.  For some reason, Wyatt was able to make it through a seam on that one and had stuffing everywhere.

If the toys are durable enough to last, the squeaking makes me wish they weren’t so durable lol. But this toy is the answer to that issue! No squeak, just a muffled rattle sound that still really amuses our dog. We’ve had it for a few weeks and not only is it still intact (even though she’s been pretty determined to chew the tail off) but it’s also one of the first toys she goes to play with! Just bought another :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This kind of toy is my dog's absolute favorite. I've bought several of these kind of toys for him and he is always very happy to get a new one. He loves to play catch, chase, tug and tear-it-up with these. There's minimal stuffing, which I like because it means less to clean up or less that my dog will eat.

The reason I'm giving the cow version 4-stars is because it's significantly more expensive than the pig version which is the same size and identical in all ways except the type of animal. I always go for the pig one but it was out of stock so I had to go with the more expensive cow.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy.... my dog loves it! It’s stood up to four days of rough play time which is pretty good for any of Josie’s toys. Here’s what I’ll say. This is the loudest most disruptive toy we have ever encountered! There are little beads in the plastic body of the toy so they rattle around at the slightest movement. The plastic body is giant so she has to work extra hard to get a hold of it, causing a really loud long intense few moments. I give it a 5 because she loves it so much and it’s lasted longer than some other Kong’s. From a human perspective though, I wish I never bought it and won’t buy it again lol. So, pick your battles when deciding to get this one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The cow looks cute and cuddly but it isn't. It it hard as a rock!

We have had it for a while now and she still won't play with it. There is something off-putting about the toy. The ""rattle"" noise is annoying but the dog cannot get to do it since she cannot get  her mouth around the toy. I bought the small size and that is even too large for small dogs. (I have a 10 pound dog) Except for the ears, feet  and tail and maybe a fraction of the body there is no place to grab.

But it’s his favorite toy anyway. It’s so lightweight with its bottle body, that he can carry it everywhere by its ears, tail or feet, and enjoy it’s rattle by shaking it again &amp; again, before attacking &amp; biting it mercilessly. It should be ruined by now...but it washes beautifully and looks like new! I only wish I could find another Kong Cruncheez in a size small somewhere. But so far, all I’ve found is a size large pig.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our German Shepard popped this in a couple of minutes.

I got it for my mini schnoodle when she was about 3 months (5 lbs) and she fell in love with it even though she struggled a bit to carry it around. Now that she’s 8 months and almost fully grown (11 lbs), she drags it around the house and naps with it. She loves it so much that I bought one for my sister’s dog as well (another hit).

Luckily my mother-in-law is willing to repeatedly sew the toy back up for my dog just to rip open again. If you don't have someone willing to sew it back up on a daily basis, don't buy it. Overall we were super disappointed, but our lab loves it, so we make it work.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy was thrown away on day 2. My 6lb, 14 week old cavalier King Charles spaniel loved this toy, but it was destroyed quickly.  This toy is cute, but very poorly made. 3 of the squeakers didn’t work when it arrived, and on day 2, only 2 of the remaining squeakers were still working.

I probably wouldn’t get this for a dog who can shred up things easily, (if your specifically looking for a long lasting toy) as he’s only a puppy and has torn it up quite a bit within the first few hours of having it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My little Yorkie loved this little toy.

It's the perfect size for our 40 lb puppy who still needs something to chew on at all times.

While she has not made it squeak yet, she is really into softer chew toys that are similar fabric to our slippers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my pups favorite toy by far. Well constructed, plenty of action, (3 different squeakers and fluffy sound and crunchy sound) and light! We play tug of war with it even! Great toy and worth the price,!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My little Yorkie loved this toy!  She barked at the Chewy box until I opened it up for her to dig out her new toys!  Chewy is her favorite package of the month!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Just a warning about this toy...when my dog chews it, the material gets stuck in her teeth and has to be pulled out of her mouth.  I should have thrown it away sooner because tonight she got a piece hung on her tooth and halfway down her throat.  She kept periodically gagging.  I had to stick my finger in her mouth and pull it out.  She's fine now.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Maltese fur kid loves to swing and shake his plush toys. This one got a little bit of play in the beginning (as does anything new), but it's way too heavy. He does well with 3-4 inch plush toys that are lightweight but have small plastic beads that give a satisfying pull in the opposite direction when being swung about. And it's definitely too large for him to throw around. 

This toy might be better for medium to larger dogs with really strong jaws and bite force (eg, rottweilers, pitties et al). Pros: sturdy build quality, a squeaker AND a low rattling (alternative) noise, and ring-shaped for tugging. Cons: too big and too hefty.

@Kong, please make a smaller, lighter version.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys

It’s a good price so I don’t mind purchasing another if it does end up tearing. Definitely worth it to see my boy happy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">After stealing her BFF's canvas Wubba, I bought our 6-month Boxer her own fuzzy version.  She loves it!

It’s a real shame because it’s probably his favorite toy, but the fur started coming out from regular play right away, and he tore a hole clean through to the stuffing after about 4 days of vigorous fetch and play.  We worry about him swallowing bits of stuffing or fur so had to throw it away.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my dog's favorite toy. She's a 50lb mutt who loves chewing, running, and squeaking. To be honest I had avoided buying this for her because she would play with one at our friend's house and it was SO LOUD.

She loves playing fetch with it, squeaking and shaking it by herself, or quietly chewing the legs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our Blue Heeler puppy of 4 months old, really loved this toy. In fact, she loved it to pieces. I understand that no toy is indestructible. But I'm also disappointed that the squeaker only lasted 3 weeks. Which is also approximately when the fabric began to separate. I would have given five stars for how much she loved it, but I still feel like it should have lasted longer then three weeks. She has multiple toys and this is one of several so it's not like it got three weeks of individualized attention!

Some of his toys he destroys the first hour he gets them, and others make it a day or so. Wubba has always been one of his favorite brands and have held up for as long as a month. 
When he saw this new toy he went nuts and just ran and jumped all over the place, throwing it in the air and catching it and then squeaking it until we thought we would go nuts. It has been a few weeks now and he has carried it everywhere with him. I never see it laying around the house unless he is laying there asleep beside it. 
I do not think it would matter what animal he gets, he would love it!
Thanks Chewy!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loved this toy but it didn’t last a week before it was completely destroyed and I had to throw it away.

Instead of buying the Duck I decided to go with the Flamingo and the Turkey because they were a little cheaper.

He really likes the squeaker and we play with it every day. It's great for playing together because there's lots of really good places for him to get a hold of for tugging and tossing around. The neck has something kind of hard and structured inside it that he likes chewing on too. It's holding up well so far but I've only had it a week. Will update if it falls apart anytime soon, but hey, I don't really believe in ""indestructible"" soft toys anyways, I kind of go in with the expectation they'll fall apart eventually, especially since he plays so roughly with them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Took less than 5 minutes on this one for the neck to break!

We have slowly lost some limbs over the weeks and it’s taken over a month for him to break into the body (fluff storage space). Definitely will stick with this brand moving forward. And did I mention how large it is? 2-3X the size of the other toys we usually buy. Would 100% recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Saint loves her jumbo plush from Frisco.

I would give Mallard duck 5 stars for being highly interesting, and 10 stars for surviving Jasper’s urge to “un-stuff“ his stuffed toys, but since his “quacker” died in less than a week, I had to drop a star off Mallard Duck’s rating.

Strong construction still outweighs noise making in the long run, so Mallard Duck rates very high in my book!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">They always go buck wild for this one.

I have a Yorkie puppy 1.5 lbs - yes a puppy and I ordered this refill and three toys - the toys come with an extra squeaker - so a total of 12 squeakers and 4 days later I have 3 squeaker refills left the rest have all died off.  Play time is less then an hour per toy - so as stated these are terrible - Love the Kong Toys they are great, but the squeakers need to be drastically improved</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’m glad Kong makes these replacement squeakers available because my miniature dachshund destroys most squeak toys in 10 minutes or less. The small toys with the replaceable squeaker seem to last longer, but she breaks the squeaker in them every time. With that being said, the squeakers are really not very good quality because depending on how intense my dog is on destroying it, they may last for minutes or days. 
But with no other alternative for replacements they do the job.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I save so much money by buying the only part of the toy she cares about. At the rate my girl chews through toys,  I can't afford to replace them as fast as she destroys them.  I rely on these to keep the play going. 

 At first I thought what would I do with these, I don't sew. But I quickly discovered effective non sew ways to use them.  Example 1:   Take old socks and quickly tied a knot to trap a squeaker in the toe.  Example 2:  Use JW Holee roller toys; you can slip squeakers into them like a puzzle toy.   Example 3: toss several into an old purse or bag and watch the doggie go wild trying to liberate them all like a game of hide and seek.   Just pick them up before demise so you can use</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Although the lives of our dog’s favorite small toys are extended with these replacement Squeakies, be aware that the squeakies are not durable.  They themselves have a very brief life at the mercy of our dachshund.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Ok, so my girl, Cleo, is a shredding/chewing/munching monstrosity- that makes me feel lucky because she drops rather than swallows each piece of toy she dismantles. I literally spend two hours at the end of each week, reconstructing her toys. These squeakers were purchased for that task. Right now we have a headless eagle (the wings still crinkle invitingly), a decapatated raccoon, and a hedgehog which are the favorites. Unfortunately, even with being wrapped in a special canvas pack, she punched holes through each of these squeakers immediately. 

Now, if your dog isn’t a tough a$s chewer like mine- and loves replacement squeaks, then get these!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog is obsessed with getting the squeaker out of her toys, but once she’s got it, the toy goes into the garbage. I cut to the chase and bought these. Not only does she NOT destroy these, she’s learned to tap it to make it squeak.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My gal is a heavy chewer when it comes to squeakers!!  But 2 weeks into the replacement and I still hear noises!!  Successful 1</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Corgi loves his squeaky toys.

Win win!! Her birthday is next month. Will definitely get more characters.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I cannot state this often enough: my dog is the problem, not the toys. She considers a new toy to be a personal challenge. So, this toy lasted her maybe 30 minutes. I knew before giving it to her that it would be chewed to pieces by the end of the day. It was, however, very cute in her Easter pictures. The ears are a bit closer than pictured, and it doesn't really sit down flat, but none of that really matters to a dog. 

I would recommend it to anyone who trusts their dogs not to destroy things, or just wants a cute Easter picture.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The bunny is well made.

However, there's a ball(?) inside as big as the stomach and very hard for my boy to bite.

Very loud squeaker, but she loves it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was expecting a soft squishy huggable bunny with a squeaker in his tummy.  Instead, the tummy is really hard and feels like it has a tennis ball in there.  You have to press really hard to get it to squeak.   It might be okay for a bigger dog, but my little doggie couldn't even get it in his mouth.  The dogs and I would have loved this toy if it had just been softer all over and not just the head, legs and arms.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought the cow for my cattle dog.  It was one of his favorites so I bought this and the fox.  The rabbit is about twice as big and that is fine.  The fabric is tough to chew through, but soft to touch.  The big squeaker in the belly is like the others, they have yet to be killed by canine chompers.

Even though he chewed the ears off of this, he has yet to tear the head open for the stuffing, which is usually the case.

When he looks like he's in chewing mode and working on it, I put it up for awhile.  It's really lasted.

The yellow one is perfect for her as she is teething and she loves chewing on hard things. She also loves the plush toys and it allows us to play with her. I also like that the fox/raccoon do not have fluff inside them, so if my puppy does rip it open she won't get cotton all over or swallow it. We've only had them for a few days, but the toys have been great and I am sure as she gets bigger she will enjoy some of the bigger toys.

That’s why I buy them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I would not recommend this toy for medium or large chewers. It was a rag within minutes. No fault of the maker.

She is a 60lb pointer, so that's not always an easy thing to find. This toy truly was ginormous and made her so, so happy. The fact that it contained dozens of squeakers just added to the thrill. I would recommend to any dog owner whose dog is looking to roll around with a toy their own size.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy has squeakers all down the body on both sides... AMAZING! Our dog uses toys until the squeaker is murdered and moves on but this alligator has been around awhile because there are so many squeakers that he gets to play over and over for a great price! He loves dragging it around and having something to really shake around and be a bit... overdramatic with. We are buying extra to stash for when this alligator finally kicks it (incase they stop selling them- you find a winner and buy 3!) but we still have awhile to go!!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Finally, a toy our big, aggressive chewer can not only chew on, but snuggle with.  We usually buy only hard rubber or rough cloth toys because our dog, Rico, will tear things up in minutes.  The soft, furry toys never stood a chance.  But this one is holding up pretty well.  Within a couple hours, he'd made a small hole around the mouth, but I sewed it up and so far, so good.  And Rico's enjoying his new pal.  I only gave four stars because of the hole and because he hasn't had it for very long.

But like with any toy, he only gets to play with it when there's someone around to keep an eye on him. Two squeakers already came out and it was a good thing that both times my husband was there to remove them from the dog's mouth. The gator's head  has started to detach from the body so I'll have to sew it back.

My dogs grab and pull/tear toys, and only sometimes chew/knaw on them... Toys don't last long in my house, so I try to buy toys without stuffing. These only have stuffing in their heads. The fabric and seams on these didn't tear easily, so it actually took a couple days for all three gators to lose their heads. Most of the squeakers are still intact and going strong. All in all, these are pretty durable for plush/fabric toy. Would definitely buy again.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys

Pros:
I've had it for a few weeks now, and my 50-lb. adolescent foxhound hasn't been able to so much as fray the edging on it, which is more than I can say about any other toys she's ever had. That alone accounts for the 3 points I'm giving this item.

But in less than 30 min it stopped squawking.  I went to squeeze is and it made a crunch sound.  

I preformed surgery on it only to find out that my Max (Pomsky) destroyed the sound box.  Apparently his tooth went through it.  I am trying to fix it in the meantime I put a ""kong"" squeaker in the toy and stitched it back together.  

He doesn't like it so much now that it doesn't talk, and that it only squeaks.

In the pic you can clearly see the tooth hole on top of the ""o"" in ""This is *not* a toy!"" on the orange burlap pouch.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves to take the squeaker out of toys!  It doesn't take her long but she enjoys the challenge.  She took the ""squeaker"" out of this toy and on the squeaker it said ""This is not a toy"".

And when it was delivered the look on his face...he thought it was some kind of magic lol. He plays with this daily and loves carrying it around and making it “bark”.  It’s his go to  toy first thing in the morning and last play of the day.  We also have the chicken and he enjoys that one too.

However, it is now day four and the toy is totally destroyed and there is foam EVERYWHERE. She has a lot of anxiety and is a chewer, and she takes it out on the donut.

Her favorite places to chew are the rain born horn &amp; tail, which are both still in tact!
Super impressed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dachshund puppy loves this toy! It is big for her, but I wanted her to have some challenging toys so I found this. It's one of her most favorites, she lovvvves chewing on all parts and doesn't get through any of it. This toy will be around for a very long time. She is engaged in all parts and drags it everywhere. Even though it is ideal for larger dogs due to its size, my little 7 lbs dach puppy plays with it everyday and loves it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is super cute but while I expected my super chewer to get through the soft bits of the toy pretty quickly, I was hoping the rope portion would hold up for more than a day. If you have a small dog, or a dog that doesn't like to chew, this would probably work great, but if you have a bigger dog or a dog that is a chewer I wouldn't recommend it</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have another k9 tuff guard toy and we love it. Our dog has been playing with it since he was a puppy and it's still in good shape. It's because of this i've been seeking out other k9 tuff toys. However, this one broke apart on the first day. The rope fell apart first followed by the fluff! I'm sure their other lineup of toys are good but I do not recommend this one! My dog is not considered a super chewer but he got through this pretty quick!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is by far my Corgi Toffee’s favorite toy.

This is the only toy she has not yet ripped open and we've had it for weeks. She's punctured all the squeakers in the body, but has not extracted them. The squeaker in the head still works!

Will definitely purchase again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Got this as a new puppy present for my mother-in-law and thought it was all three per the picture.

This was my first order from chewy and I had heard great things, but I am very disappointed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The toy I received was definitely not as pictured. It looks nothing like it.  I've always had such good experiences with chewy, but I will definitely not be ordering anything labeled Ethical Pet again!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It was not at all what was pictured, nor was it chenille.  It was just a small stuffed animal with a squeaker, plus the one we randomly got was white which looked disgusting after one use!  I would not purchase this item again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Looking at the photo, I though I was gonna get 3 stuffed animals but I only got one. Should have read the reviews before. The white teddy bear I got is a good size for my chihuahua but I feel this is pricey for only one stuffed animal. Should have not been more than $3.00. Also, it gets dirty very fast but you can wash it. Otherwise, my chihuahua loves it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy was so small. Approximately 2 inches in length. Something you could get out of a machine at an arcade. My dog likes it but is a puppy and likes everything. Definitely not worth $6. Maybe if all three toys were the shipment but definitely not worth the money!!</span>]",stuffed,plush toys

She absolutely loved this toy and we've never had a problem with her destroying soft toys until now. I can't deny that it's well made, but within 10 minutes our poor Viking friend was robbed of pants, beard, horns, and his dignity. The stuffing started flying shortly after, and with that, he was given a proper Viking funeral. If your dog is a soft chewer I can definitely see this toy lasting for quite some time!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 2 pitbulls have never had a stuffed toy last more than 5 minutes. I purchased this dragon and the Viking. The dragon was around for 2 weeks and the Viking for 3!  The dogs actually got tired of chewing and cuddled the toys.

One paw on the tail, teeth on the spine, and it was like watching a horror flick as the spine was ripped out of the gator.  And that was only the beginning.

However, I bought it for the sound which it does not make unless you shake it up and down HARD. I thought it was in the family with the chirpy birds that make 2 kinds of sounds, but its not.

My four month old miniature schnauzer was so excited to play with this new toy. I had read the reviews and liked that it had three different textures for him to chew on. Well he did chew, boy did he, and has already destroyed this toy in less than a week. The eyes have been chewed off. The nose has been chewed open. The strings on the legs are shredded apart. The belly has pulled pieces. I do NOT recommend this toy for a puppy as it will get destroyed and my puppy is only 6 pounds. I can’t imagine what a bigger puppy would do to this.

This all happened about 3 days after getting it. It's pretty cheap so we just get a bunch at a time and give them to her once in a while.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loved the unique sound that this toy made -- it seemed to really hold his interest. Which makes it all the more sad as the toy ripped within days of light play (where the leg attaches to the body, allowing the stuffing to come out)... My dog is not a chewer, but he will occasionally tug a bit, which is when this occurred; but, I would expect a toy to be able to withstand what we put it through.

Cedar is one year old ACD, is very gentle with his toys, and loves squeaker plushies. This was perfect for him! He really enjoyed the hiding element of the toys, and he loves that there's more ""squeak"" than in regular toys (there isn't, but there's usually only one squeaker per plushie that he gets... in this, there's one in each of the bees). I make it more interesting by sometimes hiding a little treat in there or some more kibble. 

The only thing I didn't love was the tufts of hair on top of the bees. It does come apart very easily and I had to vacuum that off my floor, but that's</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We previously had a hide a pig in a little piggy house. She loved to chew on the house, so that went the way of all chewable toys fairly soon.

The bumblebees fell apart faster--I think they were done in after a full week.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My small pup loves the hide-and-seek toys like this (he has multiple ones).  He's loving the little bees, but unfortunately either this specific unit had some manufacturing defects, or the quality of this particular product isn't so great.  The sewing on the tops of the heads of the bees wasn't very secure, so I ended up cutting/sewing the heads myself, as well as the one ""side"" on the inside of the beehive (that had stuffing coming out of both sides of it).  Super cute, just wish I wasn't concerned with how long it will last (especially with my pup not being a 'toy-destroyer' typically).</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I gave my dog this toy he was loving taking the bees out as I put them in then I noticed one of the bees stitching was opening and it’s fluff was out he had only for 5 mins before it started opening as he was playing. I expect toys to last a bit longer and with this you can see the seam came loose.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got the Outward Hound Hide A Bee Puzzle Dog Toy for my 19 week old standard poodle puppy. She loves it. They toy seems to hold up well to everyday play. It comes with 3 bee squeak toys that go inside the bee hive. There are three bee hive holes so the dog can easily get the bees out. My standard poodle puppy even likes to play toss with the hive. She also likes to wear it on her nose, she will stick her nose in one of the hive holes and walk around the house with it on her nose.

Got this for my 20lb dachshund beagle mix's for his 1st birthday. He ripped it apart easily. There is a lot of stuffing inside it, therefore more mess.

It is adorable! I may have not chosen the right Tuffy for my two. I think maybe something without ears or anything else that can be easily chewed off.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My American bulldog is a serious chewer!

So far there is very little chewing damage to it.  Just some fraying around
the edges (we got this at Christmas time).  He does take it away from her and gives it as a special toy so she doesn't have it 24/7. I saw this on Utube and the husky owner gave it a high recommendation as his two huskies hadn't ripped it apart either. Great toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I buy Tuffy's toys 90% of the time because they actually last. My dog chewed through this toy in about 4 weeks.

It survived forever! Great tug of war sessions and I upgraded to the large size just due to my girls being larger. I can't say enough about this toy, give them a try. I couldn't be more satisfied. I now own one of each of the ones sold on Chewy and my only complaint is Chewy doesn't carry the frog one!!! I've seen it in extra large once at a local store but I would prefer it be the same size as the rest of the ones I have. Chewy can we get that frog in stock in a large???</span>]",stuffed,plush toys

She actually played with it (which is rare since she isn’t really a dog that enjoys toys) but my only wish was for it to last a bit longer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is very cute and very affordable. However my dog chewed the velcro straps off of it within a minute, and she does not typically destroy toys. I think the straps could certainly have been better sewed onto the toy. That being said this may have been partly my fault because I put a mini water bottle in it rather than a large water bottle - perhaps if it was a full-size water bottle the velcro straps would have been more secure, but I rarely ever by plastic water bottles for obvious environmental reasons so I used what I had.

Especially if they are squeaky, I just love the squeak! I go after the bits inside. This was a treat. It almost made it 24 hours. I had the stuffing out by nightfall. I still chew on it, even though I destroyed the squeak. Ha ha!! I think my new mom is going to get me another one. I hope so.

I had good luck with this brand in the past with other dogs and decided to give it a go with my newest fur-baby. At first he didn’t know what to do with Rex cause it was half the size of him lol. Now he carries it around everywhere. He’s had this toy for nearly a month and still hasn’t destroyed a piece on it. I couldn’t be happier with this purchase.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 8 month old Dobie had a blast with Rex. He carried him everywhere before he decided it was time to destroy him. That took a few days, as he’s a moderate chewer and has lots of toys. I’d get him another one, but it’s a bit pricey for daily use.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Love the toy. It's kind of big, but the dog loves it. The only issue I have is that it's really hard to get the squeaky to work. My Rotty loves squeaky toys, but chews thru them. She hasn't chewed thru this toy, but she can't get the squeak to work.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Toke is a male Rottweiler and this is paws down his favorite toy... ever! No, they’re not indestructible, that’s why I buy them in bulk, but nothing is indestructible when it’s staring down a bite force of 328 psi.

It really lasted 1 year with a few repairs from Mom!
He takes it all over the house and really plays hard with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this toy along with the pig-version. My pit likes the pig more and it held up longer than the T. rex. This brand holds true to its description “good for moderate chewers” but won’t stay intact very long for power chewers. My pitbull destroyed this toy in two short play sessions; she had a lot of fun doing it though.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Used to pay a premium for these toys, because even after our dog destroyed them, the cleanup was relatively easy, few strings, stuffing was spun together and easy to pick up. Now the stuffing is more cloth like, and full of a fine dust/sand like material. With each head shake, our beautiful wood floors are covered in a coating of dust. No longer a recommendation I would make, and I have been a long time Tuffy supporter.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this in hopes my puppy would have a semi long lasting toy (more than a week)... within two hours the arm was completely off</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was my dogs best friend for 3 hours until he ripped it apart.

Guess she absolutely loved it... to bad the quality isn’t what we expected it to be, it was quite expensive for a dog toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our golden is very gentle with toys, so I won’t speak to the toughness, but the toy itself is adorable and he loves playing tug with it (and us). The squeakers in the wings are sometimes hard for him to find, which is pretty entertaining to watch. Haven’t washed it yet, but some of the other tuff toys we have did okay in the washer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 6 month lab/Aussie mix had this thing busted in the p minutes</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is AWESOME.  Like all Tuffy's toys, it's hard to destroy.  Our dog destroys any soft toy unless it's Tuffy's.  She is so happy simply carrying it around, though be warned, it's HUGE.  Our dog is 55 pounds (not sure of her height) and when she carries it by the tip of one wing, she trips on the other.  Pretty amusing and she's always happy to play fetch or tug-o-war with Perry/Terry.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My golden retriever is a super chewer and toy destroyer. He loves this toy and hasn't destroyed it yet!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this for my 1-year-old Irish Wolfhound puppy. It lasted about 2 days before he chewed through it</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Toy has lasted longer than most... larger than expected too.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves this toy! He's a tough chewer, but this stands up to the test. He got it in June as a bday gift, and it's still around!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this toy for my Big Gurl because she loves to seek out squeaks.  As large as this toy is it has ONLY TWO SMALL SQUEAKERS; ONE EACH IN THE SMALL FRONT WING ON EACH SIDE.  I am so disappointed in this toy and would not recommend to anyone.  Again, as large  and as much as this toy cost, it should have been LOADED with squeakers; in the head, in the main body, in the underbelly, in the tail.....</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We've had a Trex for 9 months now (it's had several surgeries and is missing limbs, but is still a dogs' favorite), the Pterodactyl might just replace the Trex as the favorite.  Like all Tuffy toys this is well made and strong.  In the two weeks we've had it, I'm rather surprised my pits haven't torn out the wing squeakers yet (that happens, even in Tuffy toys).  The lack of legs means there aren't little spots for the dogs to focus on, and that means less intentional tearing.  I suspect that means this creature is in it for the long haul.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys

The toddlers also really liked it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was one of the first toys I ever bought for my puppy. I nabbed it up before I even got her, out of excitement for her arrival. It quickly became her favorite. She LOVED playing tug with it and chewing on the rubber nubs. The crinkling sounds and the squeaking always got her attention! Now, she is almost a year old, and it is STILL her favorite toy. I actually bought her another one when she was a puppy because I lost the first one (and found it later). It has held up through hours and hours of tug. Easily the best toy purchase I made for her.

With this toy he's doing something new - actually playing with it! He loves to shake and toss it, chew on the rubber spikes, squeak the head, crinkle the feet, and play tug. I'm not sure what about this toy makes him feel playful instead of destructive. It's longer than he is, so maybe he sees it as a pal instead of prey? :) We've only had it a few days, but I'm here to buy a backup just in case that destructive urge kicks in later, plus </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a cute dog toy but not durable at all.

He loved it... to death.  In just 24 hours.  Largest surviving piece is about 1"" square.  I grabbed the two large plastic squeekers as they emerged, before he could eat them.  I just now collected the debris and trashed it.  Only nice aspect, at least it didn't unravel into individual threads, like most soft toys, so clean-up was easier.  He did like it, and he carried around the increasingly smaller corpse until it finally got too small to chew.  Advertising touted durability, and that's what convinced me to order it, so I was highly disappointed.  No value for me.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Just opened this toy yesterday, Along with about 6 other toys opened, and this was the only one my dog wanted to play with. So I’ll say that is positive. My pup was very drawn to this toy and loved it, so much that I wanted to cut my ears of because the squeaker is the most obnoxiously loud squeaker EVER...... so better for dog play when the humans aren’t home!! The toy has held up decently for the amount my dog has played with it, but in less than an hour he’d already ripped through the bottom and gotten the bottom squeaker out. I had to take it away because of the noise so not sure how long it’ll take him to get the top one out. Not an awful toy but I probably won’t be buying again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is one of the only toys that has held up to months of tug of war between 2 labs. The destroy most toys in a day and 4 month later not a rip in this one, will definitely buy more of these once this one manages to finally give out. If you have multiple dogs that destroy toys with tug of war, this is the toy for you.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I usually love Zippy Paws products... I bought this cutie for my 9 week old Maltese mix puppy.  His bite is not strong enough to 'destroy' anything (yet!), but he does like to pick up his toys and shake them like a big boy.  He loves to lie on top of this toy when napping, and has given it many 'big boy shakes.'  Unfortunately, the fabric is starting to 'ball-up' and shed already - and he's honestly not that rough (yet). I don't know whether it's the grayish color that has this problem (as mentioned above, I have several Zippy Paws toys); haven't noticed this happening to brown, blue or red velvety toys. Otherwise, would have rated this higher.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog destroys almost every toy she comes across but not only are these toys tough (she had it for a few weeks before she got one of the squeakers out), but the squeakers are big! I hate the tiny squeakers. I worry that she will swallow them before I can take it away from her.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The toy is amazing but the squeaks are SO LOUD! The dogs fight over both of them, they need to have them both at all times, but we have to make sure we give them to them to play with when we are in the mood because the sound can be overwhelming.

If they were made without the squeaks, I think we'd enjoy them as much as the dogs but since they are made for dogs, I'm giving them a 4 star rating.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 18 month old corgi, Frankie, specializes in annihilating anything plush, with a squeaker, or with stuffing. Even Kong brand toys only last about 15 minutes tops, if I'm lucky.  

This toy has lasted a few days now, squeakers and all! He's obsessed with it, doing everything in his power to tear it apart, rip open the stitching, and get at the squeakers. So far, it's held up to hours of aggressive chewing and somehow still looks completely untouched!

Thank you, ZippyPaws and Chewy! FINALLY, I think I've found a plush that'll work for Frankie!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Definitely the only one that has lasted with my monster chewer! Would definitely recommend!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this for a destructive mini Aussi over 3 weeks ago.

The toy is still brand new so I will see if I can sew the hole closed to get a little more bang for my buck.  If your dog is just a normal chewer this toy will last a long, long time.
