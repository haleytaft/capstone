She never tears up toys on purpose but sometimes when they are on the cheaper made side she does it by accident, she hasn't even made one little rip in this toy! She carries it around everywhere and ever sleeps with it and it's super high quality! It's survived so much rough and tough play! We even put it through the washer and it was completely in tact and the squeaker still works! Absolutely would recommend I will definitely be buying more from this kong toy collection!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My picky dog likes toys that is easy to find the squeaker.  It is a tough toy, but maybe too tough because she quickly lost interest.  It may be because my dog is also older and her gums could be too sensitive.  For young puppies, I can see that this would keep them entertained and it will last much longer than most plushies.  For older, picky dogs like mine, I will need to find something else.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this moose when my dog was a few months old, he is now over a year and this it the only stuffed toy that has lasted. He runs with is in his mouth squeezing it, drops it in my lap and we play tug-o-war with him and not even a single tear. He also will lay on the couch or in his bed with it. He absolutely loves this stuffed toy. Highly recommend</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy has held up fairly well with our border collie. He loves to throw it around the living room and it is the perfect size for him. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the seem on the belly is starting to come loose but that is expected with how rough our dog is. For a cheap toy it has lasted more than most.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog usually shreds plush toys in 2 minutes, and after 3 hours this one only has a small hole, and hes trying! I also got him 6 or 7 new toys in this delivery and this is the one he wont put down.
I know 3 hours doesn't seem like much but im actually impressed with the quality.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a border collie puppy only 10 weeks old - so a little guy. Chewed through this toy in a week. Kong brand claims tough toys that will last and they should given their price! If a 10 week old collie can chew through a toy in a week it’s not a tough toy. Our pups are supervised unless in their crates, this is not negligence on our part. This is a mis represented product. Very disappointed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The Kong stuffed dog toys are great. They hold up for quite a while. My dog loves them &amp; has them lined up against the wall so he can grab the one he wants to play with. He even puts it back. They all have names so if you ask he can pick the one out. I buy backups for all his favorites so when he eventually destroys one I can replace it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this as a soft cuddly toy for our new miniature schnauzer puppy. She loves it! She cuddles it while napping, but it's also sturdy enough for chewing and active puppy play. There are lots of places to grab onto - legs, tail, antlers. It also has a squeaker in it, which she loves, though she is not yet big enough to squeak it herself.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog was so happy to get a new toy. Her first kong toy has lasted her a year before it ripped. Today I received the Melvin Moose kong toy and just after a few hours of playing with it. It ripped and my back yard now is full of stuffing. Can’t believe I paid that money for this to rip so fast , and now I have to removed my little babies new toy from her</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I don’t expect any chew toy to stand up to my heavy chewing young adult Staffordshire mix, but this toy has lasted 4 months and counting, which is a first and only... none of the other Brand plushes I bought at the same time lasted a month, and this is one of her most played-with and mouthed.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/kong-cozie-marvin-moose-plush-dog-toy/dp/47739

My 2 chihuahua mix dogs LOVE shaking it and playing chase with it.  It is one of 2 toys they BOTH love.  The only complaint is I thought it was one where the squeaker could be replaced, but it is not.  This toy is sewn shut.

I am considering getting another with my next order, because if this one gets destroyed (just because I can tell it's a favorite, and I never want to lose this one!) I want a back-up replacement.  Chewy has such great prices.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Hello my name is Nuka my mission in life is to get the Squeaker And fluff out of every toy. Kong said I couldn’t do it with this one. Mommy read the reviews that it would last.....while I said hold my beer...wait I am only 2 and I am a dog!!!!! How about hold my bone! When this cutie showed up in the mail just 24 hours ago I knew what I had to do. Within 24 hours I had completed my mission and removed the squeaker. Now as we speak I am working on the moose. No fluffer is safe as long as I am around. Sure this one took slightly more effort then most but I am strong, tough and ready to defluff!

Not this time!  He's had it for over a month now and it's still totally in tact.  It's a bit stiff with dog slobber now, but no holes and the ears and tail are still firmly attached.  I am absolutely amazed and Loki really loves it.  Finally a toy he can keep for a while.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have 2 aggressive chewers that destroy stuffed toys usually in a day or minutes sometimes but love them. I don't buy them often for that reason. But these blue dogs have held up for 2 weeks so far and were on sale.(the reason I tried them). They still have stuffing and all their limbs...lol....I even washed and dried them yesterday. I will definitely buy again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 20 month old Doberman Shepherd pup LOVES LOVES LOVES these Cozies. We got Baily the Blue Dog first, and within a week we were back on Chewy to buy two more Cozies! Now she plays with all three at once, and she doesn't hesitate to use them as a pillow when she's ready for a nap. My pup LOVES stuffed animals, but usually they can't hold up to her incessant chomping (she's an extreme chewer). So far, the Cozies have! One of our favorite Kong products, hands down.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 1yr old Bernedoodle loved the Blue Dog. He played with it immediately and within a few hours the stitching began to come apart. Soon after....the stuffing was flying everywhere. I removed the stuffing from Blue dog and my doddle played with the toy for several more hours until it was completely ripped. Blue dog was quickly thrown in the trash. Don’t waste your money. Kong is overhyped and overpriced!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I love this toy, pretty tough, cute, squeaky, floppy, all of the things a dog loves.  My two Border Collies ""loved it"" to death.  Week one, ears gone, by week 3 the toy was ripped open and it was over.  No regrets, just can't buy these two anything with stuffing ever again.
IMHO, best suited for a mild chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My nearly 3 year old Goldendoodle LOVES this toy! He usually destroys toys but he has not opened this one up yet. He loves to play fetch with it and rough-house with it. He did chew off the ears and the tail. Nothing major, but if you have a strong chewer, I would watch if they focus on those parts for a while.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I read the reviews and it seemed perfect for my dog. When I gave it to her she absolutely loved it. She was walking around with it in her mouth. Then she destroyed it and got the squeaker out in not even an hour. It was a good toy while it lasted though! She loves toys that squeak</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Diamond has only played with her hedgehog until Mr. Blue came along, and now she loves both of her favorite toys. I wanted to call it Blue Dog because that’s what my sweet Jeb called his favorite toy, but when I say Blue Dog, Diamond runs to the door looking for a dog!

Too bad, because it's otherwise quite a nice toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 6 mos. french bulldog puppy loves tug of war or any rope toy games. She also loves plush squeaky toy so this was perfect. Whenever we pull it out of our secret stash she can't get enough of it. I feel like if we left them alone together for an afternoon she would probably be able to destroy it, but we reserve it for together play time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this and as as soon as I got it out the box my dog LOVED it. She usually does not play by her self with toys but this one made her entertain herself for at least 5 minutes. I was impressed and this seems to feel like it’ll last a long time so no problem there. Overall a good toy for dogs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Durable but my dog isn't a fan. I placed an order of 6 toys from Chewy and this one was her least favorite. Surprised me because she loves tug o war! Its holding up better than others but perhaps because its played with less? I'm happy with it. Too bad my pooch isn't lol</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bandit, my little Staffy/pit mix is just not into ""fetch"", no matter how hard I try.... but he love-love-loves tug of war with his ""munkey"" and even sleeps with it!  He loves it so much that he has to show it to me as soon as I get home! :-)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It is perfect for an exuberant pet, except for the hard part in the head.  I am sure it is a necessary part to get some distance when it is thrown. but our dog is hesitant.  It is well made and I like squeaking it.  Maybe it was meant for me.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We got one of these a year ago for our new puppy. 
It was bigger, more sturdy, and the ropes were harder. Stiff to be exact. It was our favorite rope toy and it lasted the longest of all her toys. And she is a pretty aggressive chewer. The monkey itself is about half the size of the one we had before. 
The new one is smaller, softer and the ropes aren’t as stiff. Pretty disappointed it wasn’t like the one we had before. Gonna give it a try and see how long it lasts before it’s torn apart.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We purchased this monkey for our golden doodle puppy in April &amp; she loves it.

I like that it's sort of like a plush (which our puppy cannot have) but has the foundation of those strong ropes within.

She likes it I just wish she’d play with it more but that’s not the products fault.

I don't know if this particular toy had a quality issue or if they are all that way. She is very disappointed that we already have to do surgery on her brand new toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 15 lb. 10 yr. old Jack Russell that destroys stuffed toys in minutes.  I buy them anyway because he has so much fun tearing them apart.  I purchased the Kong Floppy Knots Rabbit and he has been playing with it most of the day and he still hasn't torn it apart.  Each joint has a braided rope in it which prevents him from chewing thru it or tearing it apart.  Doesn't contain much stuffing but still has squeakers in it to tease him.  Great toy and it was on sale!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’ve actually purchased two of these because my dog loves it so much. She destroyed the first one as a young puppy and I thought maybe once her puppy stage was over, she could have another and not destroy it. So wrong. The ear has been chewed off. The little knotted “hands” and “feet” are now strings that I constantly have to cut off or amputate the whole foot. Such a fun toy but not as durable as I need.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My two German Shepherds love this toy and the bunny one, too. They carry them around all the time squeezing the squeakers. When they get stinky, I throw all the Kong toys in the washing machine and air dry them.

They help me open them and always look for the new toys and treats.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It took my 2 year old Black Lab 2 days to pull out the squeakers and most of the stuffing.  He pulled the ears off first.  At least now that all the stuffing is gone, the ""floppy knots"" will keep him occupied! Disappointed in this toy's performance.  Guess I should have known nothing is ""indestructible!""  I did NOT buy this from Chewy. Bought the exact same toy at PetSmart.

I ordered Bunny and Fox hoping they'd last past unboxing. Well, it's 4 days later, and while they both have been slobbered on and slept with, they are both very much in tact. After the first day of apprehension, my 70lb aggressive chewer has played tug of war, made me chase her to get them, and has worn herself out playing on her own. I haven't tested them outside, because I live in FL and it's pretty mucky this time of year, but I would highly recommended either toy for bully breeds.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">LoL this morning we found him in the living room with his toy , on the floor with strings of fabric everywhere. We usually leave him with toys we deem safe for him to be alone with, we're helicopter parents since he is still a pup, and we didn't think we'd say goodbye to this toy so soon. It seemed really sturdy and the fabric is tightly woven but his puppy teeth were too much for him. I had high hopes because the fabric felt really strong and it's from Kong so I thought it was gonna last more than a month since he has other toys but nah.

The thick corduroy-like material Is great. 100% recommend, but I will admit she doesn’t really tear into and destroy her toys... she’s a weirdo and  lays down and systematically nibbles off little pieces.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the second time I've purchased the KONG Octopus toy for my dog. The head/body has a squeaker in it and each leg/arm makes the crinkle sound. It's a great toy to throw or to play tug with. I love that it has multiple legs so that I can grab on and not have to get too close to my pup's teeth! It's quite durable as well. My 3 year old beagle is a master at destroying toys and this little octopus is still in one piece after a couple of weeks.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog, which is a chewer but not a destructive, shredding everything puppy, ripped a hole in it, pulled the guts out. I am glad that it was heavily discounted otherwise it is a complete waste of money. Since I already gave it to the dog, returning it is most likely improper. These toys are for Chihuahuas.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was so excited for this toy. Within 5 minutes, my dog had destroyed it and he's not an intense chewer. He was able to rip into 2 tentacles within a matter of minutes so it had to be thrown away! I thought with this being a KONG product, it would hold up for more than a few minutes!!! Waste of money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 32 lb Border Collie and didn't realoze a large was so... large. Haha. Its hard to play with because its so big. Totally my fault. But she hasnt ripped it open yet thankfully! And thats a feat all in itself. But its not one of her favorite toys either.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought 3 of these Kong CuteSeas toys for my 6-month-old goldendoodle to keep herself entertained after being spayed this week. She ripped through all of them in 10-30 minutes max. Keep in mind that is while wearing a cone! Not sturdy enough for chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves it! Past reviews are complaining about the tentacles pulling off. Of course they will if you pull hard on them. They are tougher than normal but they are just fabric but with nylon stitching. I wish there was a little more crackle sound but Ozzy loves it anyway!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our pups adore this one.  He's cute as can be, very durable so far and lots to play with.  The many arms make the dogs go crazy, as there are several arms that flop around while they chew or tug on one...so the action of this toy is great fun.  He squeaks easily and has crinkle inside that also keeps the dogs very interested in him.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/kong-cuteseas-octopus-dog-toy-large/dp/111169

  My dog kills ( destroys squeakers and unstuffs toys) with in 30 minutes for every toy he gets. He isn't a little dog really. I got this toy as a quick throw away. It has out lasted every other toy he's had. He LOVES it.  I have even thrown it into wash instead of the garbage.

GREAT TOY...</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Super cute tiny bear toy. Has a squeaker that is easily replaceable if you dog gets it. My dogs are not hard on toys, so this little bear is holding up very well. I like that it is the perfect size for my dogs mouth (Mini dachshund) and is easy for them to squeak it. My dogs however are not the biggest fans of this toy as they have quite a few others. So one star off for that.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The bear was definitely intended for very little dogs!  It is not as cute as depicted, but my dog doesn't care.  I did order two, and one came literally taped to the cardboard with red tape.  I was admittedly disappointed but am still a Chewy fan!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a cavalier, and she would rather play with our Beagle’s toy. This x-small toy (whose size I hadn’t realized I had chosen until it arrived) is terribly small. It is like the size of a tea light candle. Even for a 13-lb cavalier, I’d recommend not purchasing the x-small.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have small dogs who find this the favorite toy. The option to add a squeak is perfect so it keeps their attention and when the squeaker is finally “conquered” they continue to play with the toy in hopes the squeak returns.

You get 6 dinos in total so i gave 3 to the dog and set the others aside. At first shoney was excited for the whole thing but very quickly she became more excited with the puzzle toy and went right to taking the dinos out. She wasnt intent on destroying but rather enjoyed having the mental stimulation since other toys she will sit and chew till they are gone (bored dog much). Small or large dogs definitley try this toy! Im happy it came with refills and when i do need to purchase more they are inexpensive.($5) Shes been playing for 30min and not even the stuffing is out of the </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">She loves them so much! She has soo much fun taking them out of the volcano. However; the cute little dinos are not durable at all. She has only had the toy for 2 days and has ripped 3 of them. She has only been allowed to play with them while interacting with me and hasn't gotten to chew on any one dino for more than maybe 40 seconds to a minute. Easy enough to stitch up, but I do not suggest this if your dog is rough on toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this for my 2 year old boxer.  He LOVES it!!! Doesn't take him too long to get all of the dino's out, so I am re-loading it a lot, but he has the most fun with this.  This is one toy that keeps him busy and tires him out.  100% recommend for any dog that needs some brain work.  Our dog is a tough chewer, but all dino's are still in tack.   Will buying a different hide and seek plush, from the same company, as a Christmas present for our pup, just so we can switch them out once in a while.  So glad I gave this a try!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our new dog loves the Volcano Puzzle Toy.  It's perfect for a terrier who loves to stick her nose into everything!  The little dinosaurs are adorable, and we love that all of them have squeakies.  When she's not looking or chasing one of the dinosaurs, we sneak them back into the volcano for non-stop play.  We don't leave this toy out all of the time, so it's new fun everything we do.  Today when I picked it up after we played with it, she cried.  You can't get a better review than that.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It is very difficult to find a toy that our Belgian malinois shepherd won't destroy in 5 minutes. To say she's an aggressive chewer is an understatement...and I was aware that this specifically said NOT for aggressive chewers. So, needless to say, we were very skeptical when ordering this toy, but it was too darn cute not to try. She loves to play hide-n-seek with her ball amongst old towels, so I thought we'd give it a shot. SO glad we did!  She went nuts over it!  She did eventually de-squeaked the squeakers in all but one of the baby dinos, so far, but it took awhile, which we were surprised and pleased. She still enjoys chewy on the dinos a lot, even though they don't squeak - go figure!  </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy satisfies the urge to rip things apart, but all you have to do is refill the volcano with the dinos. The area around the holes has a few nibble marks already, but this toy will still provide plenty of entertainment for time to come. My dog is able to remove the dinos pretty quickly, but continues to play with it after all the toys are refilled again. I'm sure if I left her alone with it she would rip apart, but working from home it helps to keep her distracted and I just replace the dinos after she's finished removing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">On the one hand, my pup has had an awesome day hunting for dinosaurs around the house! But... Within a few hours two of them have died gruesome deaths. I don't consider our puppy to he a super heavy chewer either. The legs are the first to go. 

The volcano seems to be doing better though, and I'm using it to hide other small balls and toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’ve been looking for toys to entertain my dog while we’re working from home and THIS IS IT! He loves being able to hunt and ‘dig’ a bit to find the dinosaurs. They’re a perfect size for him too. After a couple rounds of finding dinos he’s surprisingly tired out. So happy with this purchase!!! @jerrytherealfancyboy approved!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a destroyer. He views the term indestructible as a challenge. But he LOVES plushies. He destroys everything soft within seconds but adores soft things and I always feel bad because it's clear he has a preference for his chew toys but they haven't made a soft Kevlar yet. 

With this background I'm continuously shocked when he finds one of these guys and brings it to me in his giant maw begging for me to throw it or give chase. It's been 4 months. This is with a beast that looked at the Kong toys and had started eating them within ten minutes. He took that mini tire and had it shredded in about 5 minutes. SO the fact they lasted so long is majorly impressive. I'm buying this AGAIN it did</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our three month old pup loves this. She can chew on the volcano, the dinosaurs, and she is slowly figuring out how to pull them out which makes it great for puppy mental stimulation.

There's 1 leg she done took off completely,  the other leg and arm is just about off, as is an ear.

When it first arrived we could not tell what fowl friend it was - so a Chicken-Duck it became. My miniature schnauzer, Maggie, is little for her breed and she loves her smallest toys the very best. We have three chick-ducks right now because one got left at her Nana's house and she simply cannot be without it. All of her Kong extra small toys are her favorite (frog, bear, and beaver) but Chicken-Duck is number one by far! Get one for your dog that loves small toys! It will be their favorite, too.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This super tiny duck is the perfect size for my Chihuahua but it doesn't look at all like the picture. The one in the pic is super fuzzy and cute while the one I received is bright yellow with troll hair, beady eyes and is not even remotely the same shape. For the price it is fine - it does have a good squeaker and an extra squeaker you can replace through the velcro closure in back.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Super small! (that's a good thing) and comes with an extra squeaker that you can switch out in the toy through a velcro seam in the back of the toy when the first one dies.  My chihuahua is 3 lbs and she has a hard time squeaking her toys because they are too big or tough for her.  I threw the duck and the extra squeaker in her exercise pen.  The extra squeaker provided some fun but was quickly murdered! :'D  R.I.P. Extra Kong Squeaker Born 8/24/2020 Died 8/24/2020</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Not the best toy for my 10lb shih tzu.  She tried ripping out the troll hair and I found pieces of it in her face fur, so I cut it off.  Then she tried pulling out the little straight hairs covering the toy.  From the picture, I thought it was fuzzy not hairy.  I had to toss it.  She doesn’t normally destroy toys but she made an exception for this one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Have 2 smaller dogs and this was the perfect size for the one who likes to play, but does not chew on toys.  Likes the squeaker and it is easy to handle and carry around.  Other dog chews a lot and this is not a good choice for her because she can tear it apart and eat the squeaker.  Depends on type of dog.  For calmer dog, he has had 2 small Kong plush toys for 8 years and they are in great shape and will probably keep this one for many years.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My little guy is a terrier mix. He’s past the destructive phase and I bought a few of these tiny toys. He acts like they’re his babies! He nuzzles them and he may chew them a bit, but over all it’s quite amusing that he treats them like his little charges! Highly recommend for little dogs who aren’t violent with their toys! These extra small toys are perfect!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My tiny little 2.5 lbs. Maltese puppy loves and adores all three of these x-small Kong stuffed animals! She has the frog, ducky, and teddy bear &amp; loves them all! They’re her favorite toys!

Most toys are bigger than she is, even the smallest versions available. These really are sized just for toy breed puppies!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 16lb poodle mix and he hardly ever plays with his toys. But, when this little duck arrived he went for it right away. He is so gentle with it and picks it up and takes it for a walk all around the house and back to his bed. He has it near him most of the time. So much fun to watch him with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this for my 14lbs chihuahua mix... she had the beak and a wing torn off within 5 min of giving it to her.  This has not been my typical experience with Kong, that’s why I buy this brand of toys for my dogs, so they don’t shred toys within 5 min of buying them. Waste of money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My little Jack Russel/Chihuahua loves this ""Ducky""! She carries it all over the house with her like it is her baby.

I would recommend this toy as it lasts longer than the average plush.  My dog even destroys the no stuffing ones.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog does destroy stuffed toys like this, but KONG toys have been durable for him. I decided to try this bear out because of the inner rope and “minimal” stuffing, however this bear did not last longer than a week and a half. He chewed off most of the bear’s limbs and I felt like there is way more than minimal stuffing because every time I turned around I was picking up clumps everywhere. He did love this toy and it was very cute seeing him run around with it but I would not get it for him again. Also the rope inside of it isn’t very durable either and just shreds a lot.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have to buy these in multiples because it’s one of our dog’s favorite toys!  While he loves and takes care of it, occasionally he takes it to one of our other dogs whose instinct is to destroy!  These are not for heavy chewers, but if your dog likes to love on things, these are perfect!  The more of these you carry in stock, the happier he will be!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was unsure about getting this because Duke(lab) can be a bit destructive with this type of toy but he really loves his ""babies"".   I can honestly say that Kong products have never disappointed!   Awesome quality!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our new lab puppy took to this right away! he plays tug of war with it and chews on it and although he's chewed up EVERYTHING else, This is still in good shape.  We need a backup bc he takes it to his crate at bedtime every night , he HAS to have it, so we need a backup in case it gets lost!
Love It!!  It a little worse for the wear but holds up since he's destroyed everything else</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I knew this wasn’t an extreme chewer dog toy but man, I didn’t think it was a regular plush either! My dog tore into the side and ripped half the stuffing out before having it a full hour.

Any time they get a toy, it’s instantly destroyed in a matter of seconds.  For whatever reason, they really enjoy this bear and it will last for weeks... until they steal each other’s bear and then it’s a game of tug of war til the fluff comes out.

The dogs love this game and will even often bring me a toy to put in the box for them. If you let your dog just play by themselves</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 13 y/o dog absolutely loves this toy. Unfortunately, the ball didn't last too long once he found the ""weak spot"" and tore a hole in it, but so far the other 2 toys are holding up well. I put a few of his other favorite toys in the ""box"" and he has a great time pulling them all out. It's been a great mid-afternoon distraction for him as we're winding down our day from our new normal of me working from home! Chewy is absolutely the BEST EVER go-to for anything. I've referred everyone I know to this amazing company with the BEST customer service  ALL THE TIME!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our boxer puppy absolutely loves this toy!  We have had it for a while now, and it is one of her favorites!  The soft box, rope, squeaky bone, and ball are all well made and have not ripped or torn at all.  She plays with it a lot, and it helps to give her something to do with all of her energy!  She loves to stick her whole nose in one of the holes on the box and get the toys inside!  Trust me, she isn't easy on it either!  We are so happy with our purchase and would recommend to anyone with a playful pup!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a super affordable and versatile puzzle toy! My 3 month old, 5 lb Frenchie puppy really likes it. You can use the toys that come with it or you can hide other toys in there too. Sometimes I hide treats or chews in there. My Frenchie also really likes to nap ON TOP of the toy box for some reason... don't ask me why... I guess it's an added bonus lol!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a great product! My dog loves playing with these toys! I wouldn't say she really plays the whole, 'Hide and Seek' part of the toy, but it's great for storing the toys. She especially loves the bone! It's her new favorite toy! If needed, I would totally buy another one! It is at a great price for everything included. I would totally recommend this product to anyone with a playful pup!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My puppy loves to pull all the toys out of this fabric box! She especially loves the squeaky ball. We stuff various toys/balls/treats into the box and watch her ""hunt"". Unfortunately she discovered a tag inside (her favorite thing to chew) and before I realized it she had chewed a small hole in the box. But it still works, we just have to supervise her more during ""hunting"".</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 9 year old pointer mix loves it, i didnt realize how small it was but he loved it. He's not a chewer so these will last, squeakers are easy to bite on, so good luck listening to it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Super cute, my dog loves it but is chewing up the ""box"" around each hole.  Ball was destroyed in one day.  I have a small dog with strong chewing tendencies.

I wanted to get her another hide n seek toy because she loved the last one so much, I figured on getting this one because i see a lot of people with this particular style. She really likes the hedgehogs and so do my cats!! She also likes to chew on the burrow itself, I’ll put sojo treats in there and she goes crazy!! It’s a good brain game for her when she gets bored. I like that she enjoys the ENTIRE toy. The burrow came with a couple loose threads but I’m not worried.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought the volcano with little dinos and found that Chad the Corgi didn't care much for the volcano but loved carrying the little dinos everywhere. Since then I've found other ""refill"" animals like these meerkats and the hedgehogs as well as the little dino refills. All of these little things are his favorite things to run around squeaking and taking on car rides and sleeping with. I will continue buying the little refill animals - he just loves them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a 10 week old Cockapoo who loves this toy more than anything.  He spends a lot of time pulling the hedgehogs out of the den and then we play fetch with them. He’s actually happy to just stick his head into the empty den and play with it as is. Great toy and so happy that we purchased it. Highly recommended.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Had gotten this hedgehog den with 3 squeaky hogs for our Golden when she was a pup. She loved the hogs but the den wasn’t necessary and got chewed up later in adulthood. Now with a new Golden pup, she found a hog in the bottom of the toy box and carried it everywhere. So I bought 3 hog replacements and they are her squeaky favorite to carry and squeak!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 4 month old basset puppy loves pulling the hedgehogs out and squeaking them. Great for beginners but she figured this out in about 15 mins. Still loves to play with it though and keeps her busy for awhile once she’s pulled them out. Would not recommend for power chewers or big dogs as it is pretty small. Great for introducing our puppy to puzzle toys!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy saved our sanity and many bandaids. We have a very nippy puppy who needs lots of activity and stimulation. This toy provides hours of fun without sacrificing our arms and hands to sharp little teeth. We purchased the refill after 3 weeks of use because she likes to hide the hedgehogs around the house and she has punctured one of the squeaker inserts. Not a big deal. Totally worth it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I am writing this review about 10 minutes after receiving my order and giving this toy to my dog. I found this toy as a ""recommendation for large dogs"" and I figured since it was more like a puzzle toy it would last a bit longer than it did (she has had similar toys before and some held up for months). Needless to say, the hedgehogs didnt stay in very well and she was able to get all three out in a matter of minutes and she has already destroyed one, likely would be two if I hadn't put the remaining two back in the den. I expected her to quickly destroy the little guys once she got them out, but didnt think it would take her less than five minutes to get all three out. I dont recommend this if</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My elderly small dog (16lb, 12 yr old) and my medium sized 7 month old puppy love this toy. My puppy needs to be supervised very closely as he loves to tear things apart. The puppy loves to pull the toys out of the log and get so excited when he is successful. My elderly dog loves to squeak them and licks them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our two kittens LOVE these types of hide and seek toys - so this was an instant hit. The brown plush the hedgehogs hide in are perfect for them to kick, and the hedgehogs are the perfect size for them to toss and chase around! Plus they roll pretty nicely. Wish there was some crinkle in the bigger plush toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 8lb Minature Dachshund LOVED this toy the second it came out of the box, however, the ""burrow"" you put the hedgehogs in is not very sturdy or durable... at all. She was able to chew clean through it in a matter of 20-30 minutes &amp; she is not a chewer. This is literally the first thing I've ever seen her destroy. Needless to say, I'll be tossing the hideaway &amp; just let her have the hedgehogs.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/zippypaws-burrow-squeaky-hide-seek/dp/131387

I hide her daily dental chew in the log, as well as mini milk bones. Looking for them gives her something to do. She also uses it as a pillow in her dog bed and we play with the squirrels, but hiding treats is what we use it for most often. 

This works for her now at age 11, but wouldn't have a few years ago when she seemed to take joy in finding the weak spots in plush toys and destroying them as soon as she got her paws on them.

He's not big on squeaking the squirrels, but he loves digging into the stump. I modified this toy by using scrap fabric to close 3 of the openings. Now, I hide his favorite treats (freeze dried beef liver or Pupperoni) under layers of squirrels. He loves turning the log over and over and then searching for the treats within the log. It gives him lots of exercise and still easy enough to find the treats. At first, I was afraid that the Ginormous size would be too big for him, but he's totally fine.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves it, but it would be cool if they made another version with tougher material for the log part. My doberman gets really excited when playing with this and he starts chewing the log pretty roughly, and he'd be able to destroy it in a couple minutes if I'd let him. It would be more fun for him if I was able to let him have at it a bit more :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves this toy, hide treats in it keeps her occupied for along time. I recommend having 5 squirrels in stead of 3 as your dog is going to get smarter, and will figure it out. O! My dog is only 13 lbs. though. Our Vet.

He loves to pounce on it, hear the squeakers, chew on it, stick his nose in the treehouse, pull the squirrels out. He loves for us to toss the squirrels or the treehouse so he can chase them.

She has so many toys and knows each one by name and picks out the right toy every time you say the name.  I did have to rename this one Rocky because if you say squirrel she runs over to our slider and wants to get the squirrels outside.  She loves chewing it and the noise it makes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 9 lb shih tzu loves this toy!

He knows there is a toy in the box got him. Unfortunately this one didn’t last 1/2 a day. It fell apart real fast. Squeaker broke in the first five. Then he started chewing on it. It is not very durable.The stuffing is encased a thin sheet of plastic.  He was not very happy when I had to take it away.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Sadly, this did not work out for my pups. Within 5 minutes of taking it out of the box, it was ripped open with stuffing everywhere. I was hoping with the size of this toy that it would have held up longer but the material is extremely thin.

One last thing I ordered the small one as I have chihuahuas and it is small but perfect for their little mouths.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pomeranian Sophie Pearl loved this toy.

I was kind of weary because of the price, but decided to take the plunge. I’m soooo glad I did! Bringing her home, she was crying a little bit. I turned on the heart inside of this puppy and she calmed right down and laid her head on it. Ever since she’s slept with it her crate every night</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The first snuggle puppy we received had a heart that rattled loudly. Chewy (because of their AMAZING customer service, which is why we love them, right!?) replaced it right away and the replacement was perfect. Our 8 week old english springer spaniel sleeps on/next to it every night. We used the heating pads for a few days (they really heat up nicely) but now she’s comfortable with just the heartbeat.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">we brought our corgi home on saturday and this has been so helpful in getting him to settle! we rubbed it on mom and his litter mates so it has their scent, and he cuddles right up to it whenever he goes to sleep in his crate. it’s definitely been very helpful in helping him settle and adjust!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We got a new puppy recently, he had alot of anxiety being away from his mom for the first time and he absolutely loves this thing. It is the reason he will get in his kennel at night. The heartbeat really helps calm his anxiety at night and he hasn't cried in his kennel since his first 3 days home and those three days where only for 10-15 mins Max. Huge help.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My puppy started off kind of hating this product, I’m not sure if it was freaking him out or it just took him a while to warm to it.. but we persisted because we were told you have to train your puppy to love certain things! Third/fourth night in he slept about 7 hours through the night!! It’s his favorite soft toy and not only does he sleep with it but during the day it’s his favorite toy to rough house with. He’s started to “assert his dominance” onto it which we think is really funny, but don’t want to encourage that behavior so we have to take it away from time to time! We didn’t use the heat pack as it was too hot in our bedroom. We also turn the heart off during the day to preserve battery</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We just received a brand new 8 week old puppy. She was so scared. The sound of the beating heart seemed to comfort her along with us laying right next to the crate. The added benefit was the light sound of the heartbeat allowed us to sneak into our bed and get some shut eye for a few hours.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was a little unsure about this purchase.  After bringing home, baby, she was really overwhelmed in her new environment.  The heartbeat dog was turned on.  Instantly she curled up 1/2 on and 1/2 off.  Fell asleep immediately.  Puppy is in her crate and sleeps with her during crate time.  It is amazing. I totally recommend this product.  Did not use the heater. She just needs the heartbeat.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This purchase was worth every penny. I got my yorkie puppy 2 weeks ago, she was 10 weeks old. From the first night and every night after she has slept through the night. She sleeps in a pack and play play pen . Sometimes she’s snuggled right up to it, other nights I see her not too far away. It’s worth it !!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was at my wits end with a new little puppy— a little puppy that could shriek like a banshee when crated for the night. I happened on this product in an article and WOW 100/10 could not recommend more. We went from full on puppy screams to two little whimpers and then out like a light. I got sleep!!!! I can tell this little pupperina feels better having a good nights sleep as well.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was skeptical about this product, but all the rave reviews convinced me to give it a try for my 5 month old spaniel mix who cries a lot in his crate. Sure enough, this toy did nothing to calm him down. Ironically, it did the opposite. He's so freaked out by the (very loud) ticking heartbeat that he always attacks it. Nothing about it has calmed him down.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/smart-pet-love-snuggle-puppy/dp/196019

Pretty neat idea!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We got about 2 days from this toy before it was gutted and turned inside out.  Our dog loved every minute of it and because of the ropes inside the body, it is now transformed into a different toy.  Only a minimum amount of fiberfill thankfully, which Kong should really skip putting in.

We are going to buy more to have on hand as the pig is now unavailable. Hank is an aggressive chewer but has not torn these apart. The bottles have been flattened a bit but he has not lost interest in these. The rattle sound combined with the bottle crinkle keeps him engaged.

Very durable toy and happy with this product.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">2 year old schnauzer shreds every toy I have brought home. When I brought this rattle toy home he immediately LOVED it! It is his favorite toy and the best part is he does not try to shred it. He has chewed the ears and tail off, but everything else is intact. I bought a few extras to store away for when it eventually gets torn open. But for it to last weeks/months instead of a few days and provide such enjoyment gets an A+ in my book! I have also gifted these to every new puppy owner I know!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Because this is a KONG, I bought it under the impression that it would be made of durable material, however, my 8 month old Bouvier was able to tear it apart very quickly.  All of the parts that extend from this toy, the ears, tail, legs, and even snout, were easily chewed OFF of the toy within a couple of hours of me giving him this toy.  It was very cute, and I liked that it was made with a crinkly plastic interior rather than a squeaker, but unless you have a dog that does not chew, which I don't know many, than this toy will not last long.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Super cute, but my male GSD collapsed the crunchy ball thing in a matter of minutes.  If you don't mind just a few minutes of fun if you have a large, chomper at home, then go for it!  He certainly did enjoy those few minutes. =)  I mean, it was cute.  Lol.  I think this fella is better suited for a non-chomping smaller doggo that has less prey drive.  Hahaha.

The large size is huge too! Rainbow, tie-dye fuzz ball, um, I’ll take yes for 100!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">GoDog has excellent toys but this one is not up to their tough standards. My dogs where able the able to easily pull the seam stitching out. I fixed that. The problem is the fur. They can pull it out and swallow it. They poop rainbows and have trouble sometimes with hanging strings.  They absolutely love this toy so I monitor their play time with it.  I would recommend it with caution.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">She loves it! She is obsessed with stuffed toys but unfortunately they hardly last more than a few minutes but luckily this one loses hair with every bite so she’s more focused on pulling those instead of the fluff inside which is still messy but at least the toy is still intact for day one! It’s an adorable toy and nice and big.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog DESTROYS toys. I got this for her months ago and she hasn’t even ripped a hole in it and she plays with it daily. I’m shocked. This dog can have the fluff out of a toy within minutes and this one has stood its ground. I currently get this toy for all of my friends who have new puppies. It’s a bit big but it is seriously amazing!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought two of these balls.  One for our dog and one for our daughter's dog.  Both pups are completely different in size, age and activity levels, but both of them loved this toy!  They are large, easy to throw to play fetch and keeps them entertained for a long time.  I'm very happy with my purchase.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It would be 5 stars if it did not have a squeaker.  Squeakers drive me crazy and cause dogs to tear it up (eventually).  I bought it this time so I could get free shipping.  Won't buy again until they take out the squeakers.

She like to ""skin"" the fur off with her teeth and pull any extraneous parts off them.  When I bought this, I didn't realize it was so large and it is almost as big as she is.  However, she loves it and gets it out every morning to give it a good work-over.  She can't make it squeak on her own because the squeaker is behind it's 6-pack hard chest, but she carries it around, shakes it and tries to rip its fur and tear off its ears.  So far, no damage.  I must say the mean expression on the wolf is a little disconcerting when we find it laying out first thing in the a.m., but it suits her personality!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We play pretty rough with our stuffed toys.  Typically a stuff toy will last 4-6 weeks and it only makes it that long with a couple of surgeries and usually at least one amputation.  I did have to do some minor work on the stitch on the back.  But other than that this has now lasted over 3 months and still in great condition.

BEST TOY EVER!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Nothing is foolproof with my one German Shep that loves to chew,  but this one lasted much longer than expected.  I think it lasted much longer than one can expect from  plush toy.  I just ordered another one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Looked sturdy, but our Vizsla ripped him open, sending stuffing everywhere, and in less than three days. It’s the plastic chest piece that's come off, so I don’t think it can be revived. Poor Wolf Man. We had high expectations, but the wolf was not ready for the attack.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My largest Dane loooooves this toy!

It isn’t chew-proof but he loves to hold it in his mouth and snuggle with it at night. Please don’t ever discontinue this thing!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 1 yr old Jack Russel loves his Woolfy toy! Tripp is a very heavy chewer and this toy is very durable. I give it 4 stars because the squeaker is a little hard for him to find and squeak, he hasnt been able to squeak it himself.
Also, the fur on the toy could be a little shorter. Its a little long/furry/shaggy for my liking but that part is just my opinion. Overall, Woolfy came as described!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered this Wolf Dog toy for my dog Shelby because it sounded like it would last more than 15 minutes, which is the longest any toy lasts for her. She has them all shredded up in that time. I'm happy to say she is so frustrated with this, it's driving her crazy!! We love it!! She did get the nose off after 3 days and was able to get a little stuffing out, but nothing else so far. She carries it with her where ever she goes, sleeps with it, eats with it next to her, it's great!! I recommend it to anyone who has a toy destroyer like we do. Or did!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I've been getting my Husky toys since we adopted him 6 years ago.  He loves them but always manages to rip them apart quickly and once he's got the squeaky out and destroyed that, he doesn't play with it anymore.  We tried this and he's had it 2 weeks now and still hasn't got the squeaky out and only managed to bite his nose off !!  But the great thing, he walks around with it in his mouth like it's his baby and if one of us tries to move it, he's there to make sure we don't 'hurt' it or take it away.

She will grow into it ... and it seems to be sturdy and is holding up well with tugging and toting. :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Lab puppy loves this toy - it's definitely one of her favorites. It has lots of little chewable extremities like antlers, ears and a tail which she loves to nibble on as well as having a good game of tug-of-war with the rope handles. It has withstood several months of aggressive puppy play. It has also been through the washer a couple of times and washes well. Highly recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought this toy several months ago and put it back for a rainy day. Today, we opened it.  It hasn't been out of the package one hour and she has the ears pulled off.

Great toy!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is great! We had other Kong toys (floppy knots) and love them so we wanted to try this out. It’s perfect for tugging! The body is really thick and strong and the ears are even pretty strong. She sometimes looks like she’s trying to tear them off so we redirect her to another part of the toy so it lasts longer and so far so good. She likes to bite on the body as well as the rope part and you also have a rope on the other side to hold onto. Just fair warning- it’s a big, strong, durable toy, yes, but also an ankle killer if your dog likes to shake their toys around!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 6 mo old red heeler had 1/2 the fur gone in less than 20 min. Within 1 hour, the rope was shredded as well. This toy was trashed before the end of day 1</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is one of the 3 toys my dog takes out of the toy bin on a daily basis. It hasn’t been destroyed in over 2 months of playing. I think she likes it because of the squeaker but that there’s not enough stuffing to entice her to tear it apart. She is still working on the tugging part of play but this toy makes for a good cuddle buddy... (P.S. I did not set her up like that! She did it on her own)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This moose very quickly became our 9week old Dachshund's favorite toy to play with. He took to it the day we brought him home.

Needless to say, he is NEVER left alone with a squeaker toy, and we go through A LOT of toys. 

So when my daughters wanted to get him these dinosaurs, with the volcano, I was sure they would be ripped apart within minutes. To my surprise they were not!

Such a goofball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My puppy's first toy and still his favorite.

I didn't see the size measurements and WOW....it's HUGE.  It's the same size as a good sized Yorkie (not the itty bitty ""I can fit in a clutch purse"" size, but the ones that run closer to 7-8 pounds of hard working terriers).  My Yorkie isn't so sure about this toy, and it's even too big for my pibble to play with!  I'm passing them off to a local rescue that has a need for large toys for large dogs.

For the money, this is a great toy!  I'm impressed at the size given the cost and would absolutely recommend this if you have a BIG dog or one that loves to play BIG.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 7 year old 75lb boxer/pit mix...very stout &amp; muscular. He’s always loved a stuffed “baby” with squeakers inside, but they don’t usually last long (a couple of hours- to maybe a couple of days at most). I was lucky enough to get the size large of this toy on sale for $3.68 each (I bought 3) several months back. He’s still on the 1st one! Of course he also has other toys to occupy his time (hard rubber textured chewing wishbone is his next fav). These are not necessarily more durable- but they’re size appropriate (kind of...they’re actually bigger than his head and he thinks that’s awesome!) -so he just plays with it more...shaking it so rapidly, tossing it into the air to chase it himself</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We rescued two litter mate pups when they were 8 weeks old; one male, one female.  For some reason the female, Minnie,  decided very early on that a stuffed hedgehog would become her ""pacifier"".  Now over two years later we ensure she is kept in an ongoing supply of stuffed hedgehogs.  So, when ordering dog food from Chewey I saw a sale on hedgehogs I of course added them to our order and Minnie continues to soothe herself with her favorite stuffed animal.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought this before we brought our 6 week old puppy home. He loved playing with it but just after a few weeks we notice the stitching start to give way. We were going to sew it up but when we looked closer it seemed that the fabric was completely unraveling. I’m not sure if we got a bad apple but this toy just simply didn’t last with a 5lb puppy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog loves the Hedgehog but after just a few days playing with it we had to take it away.  The fuzzy coat began to come off in her mouth causing her to cough.  The brown fur around the nose began to rip and come off,  this then let the stuffing out.  We also found that the sqeeker's in the feet moved to the middle of the hedgehog making it hard for her hard to find them.  All of these things may have been a (woops) buy the factory.  Our dog is a smaller dog and we feel that if a larger dog had got the toy it would have been gone the first day.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a great dane and this is by far his favorite toy, we have to get two a month just to make sure we have them on hand.  Our smaller dog loves them too and he loves to pull out all the different sound makers throughout the hedgehog .  We call the to Henry!! 
Its slightly larger then a football and incredibly soft as well. I 10/10 recommend.
But get the large size!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our labs usually tear apart toys in a week or less...one mission is to find and extract the squeaker!  This Hedgehog has lasted months and still shows no signs of losing a seam or coming apart...and bonus, no extra fuzzies left behind on the floor to clean up!  Fits well in a big dog's mouth.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog came to us with one of these toys, and he had it forever until it was almost falling apart and I had to take it from him for safety reasons.  I was thrilled to see that Chewy had one in a suitable size for him, and I ordered it shortly after.  The dog acts like he's reconnected with a long-lost friend, and is very happy to have it again.  I recommend this toy to other pup parents!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought the large size for my husky mix, and when it arrived I was worried it might be too big for her. It wasn’t though, she immediately loved it! I think it’s one of her favorite toys now. She loves her “hedgie” and sleeps with him most nights. We did have to cut the little felt toes off because she kept trying to chew them off, but that wasn’t really an issue. Great toy as long as you don’t have a heavy chewer!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this hedgehog for my boxer. He loves it! I was impressed how big it is. He has been playing with it for two hours now. He is a heavy chewer and did not chew through yet (I don’t care if he does, it’s his toy after all). Hedgehog has multiple squeakers, at least one squeaky one in the foot. It also has a big squeaker in the body which sounds just like deer grunt call. It is very not-annoying if there is such a thing when it comes to squeakers, haha.
Overall hedgehog looks to be very good quality.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/outward-hound-hedgehogz-squeaky-plush/dp/113809

Pumpkin does tend to pull the stuffing and squeakers out of her cute fluffy toys, but Mr. Bill has not yet met his doom.

The moment when I put this in front of her, she went nuts and jumped around for about 5mins- That's how happy she was.

The rabbit is a small... and the squirrel a medium yet they are actually the same size!! It has a good squeak to it and I have no doubt my dog will have fun shredding it!

Patricia &amp; Apple Annie</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 11 week old puppy has been happy with this baby fox for the last two weeks.  We can play tug with it (for now) but it is small and, I imagine, it won't be good for that when my puppy gets big.  She does love to chew on it though.  It's well made and is standing up to aggressive mouthing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The fox had a super hard nose, not just the black part the entire snout was hard. The fluff was not soft either. It's poor face was just ugly, not cute as pictured. 
I threw it away, thought my dog might choke on the snout if chewed off.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a maltese.  It's very difficult to find toys she likes to play with, but she loves this toy.  It's perfect for very small dogs.  I actually bought 2 more so I have a couple spares for when she wears this one out</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I had bought two different brand stuffed animals for my two dogs around the same time. Foxy and moose. Moose died really quickly (different brand) fox has lasted over a year. It has lost all but one leg and it’s tail but the nice thing is the legs are separate compartments. So when they fall (ok get torn) off the stuffing doesn’t come out. I will be sticking to this brand from now on!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have had to repurchase this toy three times because my dog loves it so much. This is the only “plush” toy he doesn’t rip up because of the rope inside of it. The only reason I rebuy them is because he gets them pretty dirty. I have a picture of his old one he had for a year compared to a new one. He plays rough with his toys and normally the legs/arms fall off but this one has lasted</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this for my boxer puppy.

Saint enjoys wrestling with Foxie and when we throw Foxie, Saint runs after and brings it back to knaw on her. Thank you for making toys for dogs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves the mouth feel of stuffies but I hadn't gotten one for her before because she's a strong chewer.  I knew this toy wasn't really designed for strong chewers but gave it a try since it wasn't too expensive.  The squeaker lasted about 5 minutes under her attention, and she ripped into the head about a half-hour later.  It was fun while it lasted. No worries, except for the head it's still intact so I removed the stuffing and put an old rope toy inside instead. I only let her have it under supervision, and she's still enjoying the now-faceless fox.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my pup's toy she takes with her when she gets boarded.

We have another GoDog toy that is indestructible, and our beagle loves it. So, I thought I would get another one. This toy has no stuffing in it at all. It is literally loose fabric wrapped around a plastic squeaker, and my dog punctured the plastic squeaker within maybe five minutes. So now, it is just a bundle of fabric around nothing. Waste of money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This squeaker sounds different than all his other toys and is basically his lovie. Our Havanese carries it around all day if we let him. The first one he had the squeaker broke quickly (lasted a month), but the second one we got is holding up well. He tends to break all his squeakers though with his sharp teeth so we're calling it a win so far.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We've had this dragon for about 3 weeks and Daisy, a 4 month old border collie, loves it! It still looks brand new and she plays with it every day. It has help up really well, she swings it really hard from the wings, ears, and nostrils and there is no damage. 4 paws up from her.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This dragon is perfect for our dog! She loves to both chew and play with her toys quite a bit, and this dragon has held up amazingly. Its been a month so far and she hasn't bitten anything off or created any holes, the dragon still looks as cute as when it was new!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I know our corgi can be destructive with toys so I try to buy ones with some sort of ""toughness"" or ones designated for chewers so I bought this expecting more than what we got. 30 minutes into play is what it took for our Ralph to tear it open.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I had really high hopes for this one, but unfortunately it didn’t last any longer than any other stuffed toy. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it’s very cute and she does really like it even with 3 legs, no squeaker or stuffing, and more holes in it than Swiss cheese.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My almost 5 month old GSD loved this thing, however, he tried to eat the ears and tore the back of the toy apart in less than a day! He loved it though, I wished it lasted longer for him!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a very cute toy with a description that boasts at least some durability. My dog was pulling stuffing out and tearing it within 5-10 minutes. Oh well!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Isn't stuffed, so she didn't try to tear it apart. Squeaker lasted long enough (~2 weeks) for dog to enjoy but not to be too noisy for humans!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Was so disappointed. Bought 2 of the large size three chew guard plush toy pack special, one with this Go Dragon. Our lab mix had the Dragon LESS than 30mins and it was destroyed and we were demanding the squeaker from him. Bought the smaller Narwhal chew guard plush toy pack special 3 pack for our smaller mixed Boston and it was gone in the same about of time.

The dino is a little smaller than I had expected, but it works for us. Love these things.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Both my Yorkie and my Pibble Mix love to chase this toy.  It's wonderful to find a toy that two so vastly size-different dogs can both love.  They play chase and they tug (the Yorkie is a beast and the Pibble is a tender hearted goofball) the toy together.  It's held up very well despite being loved by two dogs.  I wouldn't leave it outside, but it does hold up to a washing machine when absolutely required.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 7 mo Cockapoo absolutely fell in love this toy immediately after unboxing it. Unfortunately, he had it ripped open &amp; was removing the stuffing within a week. Now we're on the hunt for something more durable...... if there is such a thing!  LOL 

Would definitely recommend this toy as long as your pup isn't a hard chewer like ours is. It truly is durable, just not durable enough for our tough little guy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These GoDogs are durable toys. I have a small terrier mix who rips up stuffed toys. So I stay with soft toys. His larger dragon has lasted for years, its plates lovingly chewed off. He enjoys  this little purple guy and can carry it around. Great toy for small dogs!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a favorite for our super chewer chihuahua puppy! She loves that she can actually fit it in her mouth. The fabric is super strong. She has ripped up several other stuffed  toys with cheaper fabric. She absolutely loves that she can play rough with her purple dinosaur! She’s also teething so finding toys that will withstand her aggressive chewing is super important for us!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this for my dog when we first got her and she immediately fell in love with this toy. It has been over a year and it is still alive and well. She is obsessed with it: carries it around, grooms it, plays with it- it’s her best friend. I have decided to grab a couple just in case something does happen to this one but the toy quality is amazing, super durable. We’ve bought lots of other GoDog toys since this purchase and are always happy. I’ve noticed people mentioning in comments the small size of the toy - it is perfect for my 7.5 lbs Shorkie :) most toys are usually too big so this is great for us!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">In fairness both dogs still love it, but the puppy has ripped the head and neck off and they have pulled all the fluff out. They now just play with the unstuffed headless body.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This Dino is not only adorable, but another great find with GoDog products! This particular Dino is the SMALL version, best for smaller dogs(and a Siamese  Cat, yes I said it). Since there is a bigger version(size) of this toy make sure you check size beforehand. My mini Dachshunds love this toy, small size fits great in their mouths,durable- great travel toy for on the road moments, this small but mighty Dino has now been in our household since December 2019 and still going squeaking strong especially since I have a master squeaker destroyer! Since it is filled with stuffing we still monitor play, even if our dog does happen to creat a hole and stuffing exposed we simply remove all fluff ,quick</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 7 1/2 week German Shepard is a fan and it’s small enough for him to manage on his own.

Very cute designs that have lasted for years through may hours of rough play. Highly recommended !</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Toys usually don't last long in my house. I have a 2 1/2 year old American Bully that chews through the toughest toys in about a day or so. Usually.  He LOVES his tiger and carries it constantly.  We play tug with it, we play fetch with it, he chews on it when he lays down, he swings it around in circles when he plays by himself, and he never lets it out of his sight.  He's had it about 4 weeks now, and he STILL HAS IT.  That is incredible, and makes it his longest lasting toy ever (only his Kong ball can compare).  I usually have to buy him a new stuffed toy weekly (at best).  The tiger no longer has arms or a tail, but Ghost can still play with him.  I will only buy these toys from now on.  </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My mastiff mix is a power chewer and loves stuffed animals with squeakers! The problem is that he is a skilled surgeon and can get to a squeaker within 5-10 minutes and then pulls stuffing out all over the house leaving a little fragment of fabric. This time however, because of the hard plastic chest, it took him longer to figure out a way to get the squeaker (until day 3). The beauty of it was he had to go thru the shoulder to do it which meant once the squeaker was out he still had an intact tiger except for the shoulder to still play with. He carries it around with him everywhere. A+ for durability for a power chewer!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">this is a really cute toy!  There's only glaring problem..  His ""muscular"" chest is so hard and the squeaky is under the hard plastic chest, so   that unless you're giving this to a Pittie or another muscle dog, your pup may  not be able to play with it as he/she normally would.  
My boy tried.  He ultimately picked it up and put it in his toy box by himself!  
I would certainly not get this for a smaller dog, but a big dog may still have fun with it so I'll still give it a recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Usually any toy we give our doggos lasts anywhere from 1-8 hours. This toy has lasted them a month now. I think it's because of the heavy duty material that's on the tigers chest that makes it difficult for them to rip any stitching. They love it and it keeps them busy, so I'm super impressed with this purchase! Worth the $$$!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I really recommend this toy to anyone. This is our puppy's favorite because of so many reasons. It's large and weighty enough so he can fling it around and release a ton of energy. I personally love this because it keeps himself busy, but when I want to, it's easy to play tug of war with. It has a squeaker (which he can't quite get to yet because his jaw isn't large enough) that easily draws his attention when we squeak it. The plush has a durable liner so it's still in perfect condition despite his destructive tendencies. I have a feeling this is going to be his favorite for a long time, because the abs are made of a tough rubber which he can't grip yet, but will be perfect for when his jaw </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Not only are these toys hilarious, but the rubber abs makes them a bit more resilient. I have a 60 lbs pit mix, and while I’m sure she could probably tear this sucker up if she really wanted to, she has a blast squeaking him and throwing it around the room. Super great, and relatively durable for a plush toy. This toy is her favorite! 10/10 recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our boy Bruno his a Cane Corso just loves these toys he has this one, the lion, rhino and has not tore them up he just sucks on them. Very good quality would recommend this toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog a boxer at first loved this toy. And I appreciated it cause he didn’t tear it up
In 5 minutes. But after a day of having it we noticed white little things coming from it. I don’t know if it was sand/bugs or what but regardless of what it was you don’t want your dog chewing on an item like this. Actually chewy should consider removing from their site in general</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">She carries Aubie with her everywhere, even sleeps with him.

He has shaken it around enough and we've tugged it enough that the squeakers in the neck have scooted down and the neck no longer stands up on its own, but that doesn't mean anything to him. He carries this thing to bed and everywhere. I'll be buying another few of them for just in case, but it is worth it for how much he loves his</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I can't believe how tough this cute toy is.  It's survived over 2 months of ferocious tug a war battles between my English Springer puppy and her Blue Heeler sister.  So far no loss of the squeaker, limbs , head or tail.  I'm very impressed and I will be looking for this brand in the next toys I buy for my pups.   It's one of my dogs favorite toys  so it gets a workout every day.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Just 1 squeaker to be found inside this toy.. in the head.. nothing to engage with in the rest of the toy. A bit disappointed as I chose this due to the size and was hoping to be able to squeak the opposite end of the toy to what my dog would have in his mouth. Otherwise it's well constructed and a really fun boy toy vs so many of the girly toys out there.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My girl Meisha LOVES her squeakasaurus! The neck is extra long and has 2 big squeakers and she tears apart a lot of toys, but not this one! She will bring her squeakosaurus when she wants to play, its her toy of choice. Couldn't have asked for a better toy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I am returning to buy Lily's THIRD dinosaur toy. This is consistently her favorite toy. I have to immediately cut the squeaker out and sew it back up, but without a speaker she will make each toy last about a year. So I came back to Chewy to replace her beloved dinosaur, yet again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This dinosaur is a nice size for larger dogs and really cute.  I was disappointed, however, in the squeakers.  Nothing in the big body to squeak.  The squeaker in the face didn't last but a few minutes.  Fortunately, the tube-type squeaker in the neck still works.  I prefer the other Frisco Wagazoo line -- those really squeak for a very long time.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/frisco-squeakybeasties-squeakosaurus/dp/193195

Well made, survive repeated washings in a dedicates bag without seams opening up. Literally have lasted years and my cats all have Full Metal Jackets, as I don't believe in declawing. Different sizes for different pets. I recently purchased these to make a mobile I'm hanging up in their cat room, for my Game of Thrones Feral kittens I rescued 3 years ago. Khal Drogo, Arya, Tyrian, Jon Snow, and Khalissi  all love these Frisco toys (squirrels, raccoons, aliens, T-rex) and spend hours playing with them. They are so cute and well made, your kids will want to play with them too. Khalissi can finally have her 3 Dragons flying</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My best dogfriend, Agnes, loves this kind of toy. Weirdly, unlike MANY stuffed toys, she doesn't immediately eviscerate these little dragon buds...she probably heard about that fire-breathing thing, so she's extra nice to them.
The castle itself is pretty burly, too. For this price, this is a great toy, and Agnes sure seems to have fun with it. :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I purchased this set of toys for my 5lb pomeranians and they love them!  They are small but not to small, light weight, well made, and look exactly as the picture shows. You can also buy replacement dragons if anything happens which is great.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought 2 dragon puzzles for our beagles, Jack 8yrs old and Minnie 4yrs old. Minnie is in the attached picture.  Minnie removed all the squeakers after an hour of playing with us and Jack.  We tugged with the dragons, threw them for catch, played hideaway with the dragons and Minnie decided to take 1 of her dragons out to go potty.  She then decided to cuddle with all her dragons for a nap and we took a picture.  Jack played all day long with his dragons and castle.  The squeakers are still in the dragons.  He loves toys to squeak!! We played catch with him too, hideaway and tug also...after awhile Jack cuddled with his babi too. Great toy but puppies must be watched because of the squeakers</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The dragons are mid-level durability but my dog quickly tore into the castle (like, within 10 minutes). very cute but not the best item for a heavy chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is adorable and my 7 month old puppies were so excited about it but one of them gnawed the open and ripped it within the first minutes of play.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Sturdy feeling, dragons are stuffed well, seams sewn well.  My little guy loves it! BUT!  I do want to warn others, while playing he forces his head thru the holes and gets his head stuck-to the point he has to be helped to get it off, lol.  It is soft, so toy doesn't hurt him, but he runs into everything in sight panicking because he has no way to pull it off. I make sure to put it away when I leave for now, hes only 2 months old.  Im sure he grow enough it wont be an issue soon, but did want to tell others.  I also bought the extra dragons theres plenty of room to add them now or his other balls/small toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I purchased for my pup to keep him entertained when I go to work as he has become destructive after having me home for 8 weeks during Covid.  This is 13.00 and described as for medium to large breeds. It is pretty tiny and he has 0 interest in it. My wee girl who is 8 and years past destructive age can fit her nose in but my big pup cannot.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this dog toy for my 4 month old pup and she loves it.  However, my 7yr old granddaughter also does - the three little dragons are terrific ""stuffies"" for her play.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Item looks just like the picture! My lab loves pulling the dragons out and squeaking them. The wings are a bit small, I may cut those off so he doesn't try to eat them. I do wish the holes were just a bit smaller, sometimes the dragons fall out when he carries the toy. I would suggest buying the dragon refill pack with this item since the castle is a good size and can definitely hold more than 3 dragon toys.

I bought this after buying the Frisco Hide and Seek Plush Chewy Box, which my lab also loved! Compared to that toy, the walls on this castle are a little thicker and are made with tougher material.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/frisco-mythical-mates-hide-seek-plush/dp/231103

I adopted a dog from a bad circumstance, the first thing she wanted to do was get in the trash - probably how she got a lot of her nourishment : (  in her past life.   The trash is a no no here, not a harsh word no no but she understands.  So she was happy to get a new toy but that crinkly sound made her stop, she looks at me, thinks and she drops it.  She left it alone since.  My guess is lots of things in the trash make that crinkly sound just like this toy and that's a no no sound.  Therefore a failure but not because it's a bad toy, it's adorable, thick material and well sewn.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We love Frisco toys in our house! Please note that these toys will NOT last a long time if you have a tough chewer. My dog loves the squeak and will stop at nothing until it is destroyed and he has SO MUCH FUN, so it’s worth the 1-2 days of fun for my dog. Plus I love that Frisco has so many cute toys it’s fun to watch and think of silly names for them. This guys name was Leon, And Charlie loved, “Go get Leon!!!” while it lasted!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">When I got this toy, I was initially disappointed because it looked super deflated, but then I realized that's because its crinkly, not fluffly! It is so cute and my dog LOVED it at the beginning but he's not super into it now. Crinkly toys were his favorite. Alas, he has moved onto squeakers. So cute, loving this brand, good to have another crinkly toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 44 lb. rescue dog likes her new toy.  It's her 2nd fav (first is an old soft squeaky).  I like this one because it's colorful and doesn't appear that it will be easy to destroy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Cocoa aka Chameleo Estevez, is hands down Wyatt's favorite chew toy,  He takes him outside and wanders around with him dangling by the tip of his tail from his mouf. Yes, mouf.  No clue why the tail tip is such a fave bit to chew, but, again, the material that is used in the Squeaky Beasties line is nearly chewthroughproof.  There is a larger version of the chameleon, which does have stuffing in it to keep shape.  For some reason, Wyatt was able to make it through a seam on that one and had stuffing everywhere.  Chameleo's dad, Martin, needed surgery to close him up.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">No stuffing which is great! Sounds like a crunchy water bottle inside with tons of places to squeak. My dog Elsa loves playing with her Dino toy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this as a first birthday present for my cat. He's 15lbs and a bit of a brute. Most toys that are marketed for cats, especially plush, simply aren't very durable so I shop the dog department. Cocoa did not disappoint. This toy is exceptionally well made of a soft-but-strong fabric and has sturdy seams. The squeaker bulb sounds like a clown car (not too shrill), and the safety pocket it's encased in makes crunch and crinkle sounds that really get my cat's attention. He grooms her, nibbles her toes and tail, and ""bunny-kicks"" her when he feels feisty. Super cute, high quality, great value. Winner, winner, chameleon dinner!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">He loved this toy, but unlike the others. it didn't hold up to his brutality, although he tour out the guts, he still carries the carcass around with pride.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It is colorful as well, but the squeaker will only be good for one day, if you’re lucky. I do realize that my small dog chews very hard &amp; because of this the squeaker gets wet. I’m always looking for a tougher toy for her, but in this case, this is not it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The toy is exactly as described- it's durable and adorable.

However the size of these toys seem to be a perfect fit for him.  He walks around carrying these squirrels, squeaking away.  He tosses them up in the air, catches them, pounces on them and continues to ""chase"" them as he tosses them.  He will eventually go after the squeaker, but even when that is gone, he continues to play with the squirrel.

We call it “baby” and we take baby out to potty, take baby to bed, can’t get out of bed without baby, and on and on it goes.

The butt ripped first and I sewed it up then the next day the head was missing. Now he just carries the empty duck body and he loves it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is large and has a loud squeak. But the squeaker seems somewhat protected, so it's not like other toys where the dog punctures the squeaker in a few minutes and then it is broken.  I'm sure very aggressive chewers could make short work of this toy, but my dog can use this for a long time without any lasting damage. Can also be machine washed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I don't know what it is about this dumb duck, but it is the only toy my dog will consistently play with. Even different colors, I can just buy one to replace the other and it is still his favorite. He's not a chewer so they last a really long time (I usually buy a new one when it gets gross, not when it gets torn up), but I don't think this would stand up to a dog that likes to tear things up. That said, if your dog is a cuddler and not a tearer, this is excellent. I've bought four of them so far.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this for my granddog when my daughter brought him home.  This was his first plush toy and as an 85lb 1yr old puppy it is still his favorite.  For whatever reason he has not destroyed it! He won’t leave the house without it!  It goes with him
In the car everyday on the way to day care.  I’m shocked at how well it has stood up to a large breed dog for an entire year</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">If my dog was writing this review, she'd give it 100 stars.
Any time we get her one of these toys, she runs around the house holding it like a security blanket and whining because she wants to find a secure place to bury it somewhere in the couch. We've had to replace them over the past 2 years when she got too excited and tore them open. But it doesn't matter what color it is, she freaking LOVES ducky! If your dog loves stuffed toys and is relatively gentle chewer, ducky is a must. I sincerely hope this product never leaves Chewy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">He immediately tried to steal it out of the box as soon as I opened it! It’s a nice sized toy for a golden retriever but I don’t really expect it to last that long.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pittie, Abby, loves these.  We call them platyducks because they resemble a platypus/duck. I just put them in the washer and dryer and they clean up well.  She has one that is about 5 years old and it is still intact.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Duckworth is our three year old Golden Retriever’s absolute favorite toy!  We bought her her first one when she was a baby and it was an instant friendship!  She stripped the toy of its stuffing right away and carried it limply everywhere!  When Duckworth finally bit the dust, we replaced it immediately and for another year it was gutted and carried around everywhere.  She is three years old now and we bought her a third one.  She loves this one too.  She has had it for a few weeks, stills carries it everywhere, and has not gutted it yet.  Our baby is growing up.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought on a whim at my local pet store but didn't expect it to last long as my dog typically destroys soft toys within 24 hours. But she loves them and it wasn't crazy expensive so I figured what the heck. Fast forward weeks and this is amazingly still intact! Something about it's size and simplistic design (i've noticed that there isn't that much stitching to get at) has really discouraged my dog from destroying it. So she wind up carrying it around like a big pink fluffy ""teddy"" duck. Maybe it's so fuzzy that she can't see the stiching? not sure but it's the best purchase ive made.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We lost the mother dog of 16 years early this month. Her first born(franky) was alone for the first time. I sent for duckworth and it was the perfect comfort toy. Franky loves ducky.

Both of them went nuts for this! I put all the pieces in the cauldron and they both pushed each other around getting one out.

They love the small toys and can fit inside the larger toy for a nap. Normally they're great, but this one doesn't sit properly.

I did have to cut the spiders legs off as she ripped one off within minutes but a legless spider is still fun for her.  The eyeball is her favorite lol!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is such a great puzzle toy! I love how festive it is! My pups love the bite sized bats to chow down on. It’s definitely a toy meant to entertain. It’s also not a toy that will show all the dirt and slobber from it. Some toys quickly get dirty just from a couple of tosses and slobber, but this toy is spellbound from that!

This rabbit has been around for 2 weeks. (and it still squeaks) Usually these last a day until she has a hole it and the squeaker is gone.

Was really surprised with the durability this time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I like to buy the Kong Brand toys for my dog. I've noticed that the quality of the stitching is not holding. They used to be the best toys I could find, but it seems they aren't that way any longer.

If the toys are durable enough to last, the squeaking makes me wish they weren’t so durable lol. But this toy is the answer to that issue! No squeak, just a muffled rattle sound that still really amuses our dog. We’ve had it for a few weeks and not only is it still intact (even though she’s been pretty determined to chew the tail off) but it’s also one of the first toys she goes to play with! Just bought another :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This kind of toy is my dog's absolute favorite. I've bought several of these kind of toys for him and he is always very happy to get a new one. He loves to play catch, chase, tug and tear-it-up with these. There's minimal stuffing, which I like because it means less to clean up or less that my dog will eat.

The reason I'm giving the cow version 4-stars is because it's significantly more expensive than the pig version which is the same size and identical in all ways except the type of animal. I always go for the pig one but it was out of stock so I had to go with the more expensive cow.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy.... my dog loves it! It’s stood up to four days of rough play time which is pretty good for any of Josie’s toys. Here’s what I’ll say. This is the loudest most disruptive toy we have ever encountered! There are little beads in the plastic body of the toy so they rattle around at the slightest movement. The plastic body is giant so she has to work extra hard to get a hold of it, causing a really loud long intense few moments. I give it a 5 because she loves it so much and it’s lasted longer than some other Kong’s. From a human perspective though, I wish I never bought it and won’t buy it again lol. So, pick your battles when deciding to get this one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The cow looks cute and cuddly but it isn't. It it hard as a rock! There is hardly any place to grab onto. Normally when my dog sees a new toy she goes crazy and grabs it and plays with it  for a long time. This time as soon as she saw it she backed away from it. We have had it for a while now and she still won't play with it. There is something off-putting about the toy. The ""rattle"" noise is annoying but the dog cannot get to do it since she cannot get  her mouth around the toy. I bought the small size and that is even too large for small dogs.

But it’s his favorite toy anyway. It’s so lightweight with its bottle body, that he can carry it everywhere by its ears, tail or feet, and enjoy it’s rattle by shaking it again &amp; again, before attacking &amp; biting it mercilessly. It should be ruined by now...but it washes beautifully and looks like new! I only wish I could find another Kong Cruncheez in a size small somewhere. But so far, all I’ve found is a size large pig.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our German Shepard popped this in a couple of minutes.

A sweet little soft toy that she actually enjoys playing with. The monkeys are soft and squeaky, but not too annoying. We’ll see how often she is willing to play ‘hide and seek’ with these little guys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The monkeys from this toy are incredibly cute and soft. But they came by themselves. Not sure why there was no tree? This was a favorite toy of our older dog, so was hoping for the hours of entertainment with our puppies.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this for Doc who is 100lbs baby Doodle, at 2 years old.  He loves to hide things in blankets, under rugs, in the bed...our little guy likes it too, but only wants to steal a squeaky monkey and drive Doc nuts!   It’s a circus here!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The brown tree fur easily fell out just by moving my hand over it (see pile of it just to the left)I didn’t find this out until I saw my puppy (7lbs) with a mouth full of it. The monkeys are cute and luckily my pups still enjoy playing just with those but the tree is going in the trash.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have Labradors. While we would never leave this toy with them alone, it's a ton of fun watching them find the monkeys and proudly present them to us. We have even had a group play together with it. The little squeaky toys are not sturdy enough to hold up to their enthusiasm, however, so we must rescue them promptly. It served our purpose: a fun time of fetch, find, and frolic. You can also stuff the tree with paper (sturdy packing paper that comes in shipping). They love pulling it out! Makes a bit of a mess but easy clean up. Great toy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The dog loved this SO MUCH. Her favorite toy. She pulled the monkeys out with such force and glee it hit the ceiling and bounced off the window. Love that you can buy refills for the toys too</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy keeps our puppy engaged and entertained.  He loves pulling out the monkeys and playing fetch with each one.  Also loves to make them squeak while chewing on them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We just received our toys today and this is a huge hit! I highly recommend this toy for supervised playtime. I will definitely purchase again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">As the other Hide and Seek toys have been a hit, I ordered the monkeys. Doggies are happy! I also like that I can get extra monkeys so everyone gets one!</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/frisco-hide-seek-plush-tree-puzzle/dp/201449

She has them scattered about during the day then collects them together for the evening. It’s an adorable toy to see all over the house, inside and out.

When I come home, he goes and gets this toy! His once nemesis has become his best friend! He doesn't even maul it, break its little neck, or pull its fibrous guts out!

We got Mr. Cow for my other dog who wasn't so much a fan of it. It was kinda one of those toys that we have laying around! But he loves it because he was able to get it to Moo!

It was so much fun watching him squeeze the cow, run when it moo'd, then come back and do it again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My two pups loved this toy. It actually lasted a lot longer than anticipated. The mooing is annoying to humans but not to dogs. Each photo shows a different cow. We received the one in the first picture.

That noisy thing is still going strong and they love him! The cow didn't last a day the poor thing. BEWARE! There's a box inside containing tiny parts.

This isn’t necessarily a problem for my dog as she is more of a squeaker/shaker than a chewer but I could see it being nice for other dogs. Overall I really like this toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this for our new dog because she had a unicorn at her foster home. She loves it! She isn't a huge toy chewer but she does play hard - runs around with it and shakes it very violently and it's held up so far. Our other dog likes it too and he's generally gentle with toys (though he will take the opportunity to destuff a toy if there's a rip). I definitely wouldn't recommend this if your dog(s) like to ""kill"" their toys because it for sure won't hold up to repeated attempts to rip it apart but for dogs who just enjoy having toys to toss around and chase, it's perfect.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The description states there are 4 squeakers in the feet of the toy. I purchased the small purple unicorn. There is ONE in the middle of the body. SO disappointing.  My small Chihuahua LOVE plus squeaky toys but it's so hard to find ones that are plus, small enough and he can squeak easily.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bear took a week or two to 'get' toys and he's very picky about them.  However, he absolutely loves this one!  I have to watch him with it because he'll try to gnaw on it, but it's the perfect size and it makes him happy.  It seems pretty sturdy as well. 
 Great price and adorable.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought 3 of these to keep in reserve for our Pit Bull mix.  She has a stuffed unicorn that she carries everywhere with her. We know her current unicorn won't last forever so we purchased 3 of these to make sure she never is without one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My little pup is obsessed with this toy! She grooms it and it’s the first one she wants in her toy bin. It’s the perfect size for a small dog - she’s 2 lbs right now and the toy is still massive compared to her</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a chihuahua mix who tears apart most stuffed toys within 5-10 minutes. This unicorn is my dog's new favorite toy, and the best part is, it is taking him weeks to tear it up! After two weeks, the squeaker is still inside (unheard of!) I can't recommend this toy enough.

It's got tons of squeekers, which my 1 year old lab loves and it's fun to shake around. However it rips literally every time she plays with it. Luckily my mother-in-law is willing to repeatedly sew the toy back up for my dog just to rip open again. If you don't have someone willing to sew it back up on a daily basis, don't buy it. Overall we were super disappointed, but our lab loves it, so we make it work.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy was thrown away on day 2. My 6lb, 14 week old cavalier King Charles spaniel loved this toy, but it was destroyed quickly.  This toy is cute, but very poorly made. 3 of the squeakers didn’t work when it arrived, and on day 2, only 2 of the remaining squeakers were still working. It was coming apart at multiple seams and stuffing was all over my living room. I do not have a 100 pound destructo-dog. This toy was very overpriced for the quality, and a true disappointment.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/frisco-puppy-lil-romps-squeakerpillar/dp/193090

Instead, the tummy is really hard and feels like it has a tennis ball in there.  You have to press really hard to get it to squeak.   It might be okay for a bigger dog, but my little doggie couldn't even get it in his mouth.

Knowing your animal's limitations and likes, goes a long way in deciding which toys are worth spending on.

I don’t mind that much because I love seeing him so excited. He cuddles it, chews it, and swings it. Teddy is a very aggressive chewer so I’m impressed that the wubba has lasted two weeks already. It’s a good price so I don’t mind purchasing another if it does end up tearing. Definitely worth it to see my boy happy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">After stealing her BFF's canvas Wubba, I bought our 6-month Boxer her own fuzzy version.  She loves it!  It combines her love for a squeaky tennis ball with a tug toy and a plush toy.  Just wish you could pick the character.  But she loves her fox.   While she still takes her friend's Wubba in play, she returns it easily now!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our Ollie LOVED this wubby to pieces within about a week. 

It’s a real shame because it’s probably his favorite toy, but the fur started coming out from regular play right away, and he tore a hole clean through to the stuffing after about 4 days of vigorous fetch and play.  We worry about him swallowing bits of stuffing or fur so had to throw it away.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my dog's favorite toy. She's a 50lb mutt who loves chewing, running, and squeaking. To be honest I had avoided buying this for her because she would play with one at our friend's house and it was SO LOUD. But eventually we got her one and it's her favorite so we bought a replacement when that one got worn out. It satisfies all her general play preferences. She loves playing fetch with it, squeaking and shaking it by herself, or quietly chewing the legs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our Blue Heeler puppy of 4 months old, really loved this toy. In fact, she loved it to pieces. I understand that no toy is indestructible. But I'm also disappointed that the squeaker only lasted 3 weeks. Which is also approximately when the fabric began to separate. I would have given five stars for how much she loved it, but I still feel like it should have lasted longer then three weeks. She has multiple toys and this is one of several so it's not like it got three weeks of individualized attention! She is also a fairly aggressive chewer, but her other similar toys have been able to withstand her habit.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Kinda Disappointed in in this toy! Didn't hold up at all! I have had these kind of toys not this one but others that lasted Months if not over a Year! wont buy this one again!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a two year old pound rescue that is as cute as can be, but he is an active chewer. Some of his toys he destroys the first hour he gets them, and others make it a day or so. Wubba has always been one of his favorite brands and have held up for as long as a month. 
When he saw this new toy he went nuts and just ran and jumped all over the place, throwing it in the air and catching it and then squeaking it until we thought we would go nuts. It has been a few weeks now and he has carried it everywhere with him. I never see it laying around the house unless he is laying there asleep beside it. 
I do not think it would matter what animal he gets, he would love it!
Thanks Chewy!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loved this toy but it didn’t last a week before it was completely destroyed and I had to throw it away. Because it was from Kong I thought it would be tougher. I think it would be great for a less determined and destructive dog but it’s not good for rough playing dogs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Chihuahua plays with this by herself most of time but when she is feeling frisky she likes to take it to take it over to the kids to play fetch. She is almost cat like rolling around the floor with it when she is by herself. I do wash it because it will start to smell if they use it a lot like she does. This is our second one we are going through. I meant to order 2 but made a mistake when ordering. Sometimes they sell out quickly in the small size.

So excited that I found this one. My friend sent me a video of her opening up the package to find the squeaker was already broken. It arrived defective.

Bought another one for a friend of mine with a seven month old labradoodle</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’ve purchased this toy in the past from a retail store in the duck variety. My dog is a huge fan of the honking sound these make over the regular squeak sound most other plush toys make. My dog is a chewer and the original duck I bought lasted a decent amount of time so when I saw they were available on Chewy I was all for it! It’s hard finding a decent quality toy that honks. Instead of buying the Duck I decided to go with the Flamingo and the Turkey because they were a little cheaper. 
TURKEY: The Turkey is happily still honking around the house weeks after purchase. I assume it will have the same life span as the original duck I purchased which makes it a great buy!
FLAMINGO: The Flamingo</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My lab/pit mix LOVES her new duck. Durable (so far) and is still quacking.

He really likes the squeaker and we play with it every day. It's great for playing together because there's lots of really good places for him to get a hold of for tugging and tossing around. The neck has something kind of hard and structured inside it that he likes chewing on too. It's holding up well so far but I've only had it a week. Will update if it falls apart anytime soon, but hey, I don't really believe in ""indestructible"" soft toys anyways, I kind of go in with the expectation they'll fall apart eventually, especially since he plays so roughly with them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Took less than 5 minutes on this one for the neck to break!

The toy comes fully equipped with crackly material and squeaker built into the balloon part of the toy.
The rope attached is sturdy but pliable.
The only improvement I would have made would be a change in material covering the ball to a canvas texture instead of the plush so it would be better suited for outdoor fun and doggie slobber.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My now 1 yr old puppy is in Love w/this! I can dangle it and she will jump at it or I can toss it and she will retrieve it! So far, she hasn't chewed it up, as she does w/many of her toys.

So far, I found this to be a tougher toy for her as some she's chewed right through in no time!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The pibble loved it and especially liked the extra long rope. He played with it for a month or so before he decided to easily decapitate it and de-squeaker it. It's definitely meant for a medium to light chewer who is a little more on the gentle side.

She loves the balloon part, to crinkle and squeak and the rope is her favorite! She has got my older dog to play with her, this was originally his toy and he never got into it ( but he only likes tennis balls )! I’m ordering a new one because the puppy has unraveled the rope half way. I will probably put a extra knot at the end to hopefully prevent that from happening again.

Even though he chewed the ears off of this, he has yet to tear the head open for the stuffing, which is usually the case.  Also the body material is all one piece so it takes ALOT of tugging with no damage.  I was so happy with this bear that I ordered another.  When he looks like he's in chewing mode and working on it, I put it up for awhile.  It's really lasted.

I would give Mallard duck 5 stars for being highly interesting, and 10 stars for surviving Jasper’s urge to “un-stuff“ his stuffed toys, but since his “quacker” died in less than a week, I had to drop a star off Mallard Duck’s rating. (Given that all our other “Multipet” brand characters are still going strong months later, I have to assume this Mallard duck had a defective “quacker.”) 
Strong construction still outweighs noise making in the long run, so Mallard Duck rates very high in my book!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">They always go buck wild for this one.

They are not high end toys but they are good for when you need a variety, and now I know what to get more of for her.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It comes with a lot more despite the lower price; which is fantastic!

I’m not going to call the toys super high quality, and if your dog is a strong chewer they’ll chew through the red toy very quickly. But getting this many toys for such a cheap price was great. The yellow one is my puppy’s favorite thing to chew on. I like that the pink one has holes in the sides, because I hide treats in there. The rope ball is too big for him to play fetch with but he likes chewing on it. The blue ball is a tiny bit smaller than a tennis ball, so it’s the perfect size for my puppy to play fetch with. And most of the toys squeak! Overall, a great deal.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our pups were super excited with most of these toys. There was also a blue ball that came with the set that squeaked. The red and green chewables are extremely fragile. We bought these primarily for our 6-month old puppy to teeth on, but our 10-year old golden got ahold of the green bone, and had bitten off a chunk within a minute. After that, it stopped squeaking. A few minutes later, we noticed the red toy had stopped squeaking just from our puppy biting it (must have punctured a hole or something). Similarly, the yellow and white toy is already significantly chewed down just from a few minutes of play. We got this set today and already have 3 of the 10 toys nearly out of commission.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pup enjoys this bundle.  He takes a couple to his crate, on his bed, on my bed, in the living room etc. I bought a few other toys too.  He has 14 toys.  My old dogs enjoyed taking them right out of the box when they arrived but have left them alone since.  They weren't playing with toys before these arrived so I didn't expect them too.  I recommend them for the right age pup.  I see reviews say they don't hold up to large older puppies.  But so far, so good.  He loves all the toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 8-week old pug puppy loves these toys. The yellow one is perfect for her as she is teething and she loves chewing on hard things. She also loves the plush toys and it allows us to play with her. I also like that the fox/raccoon do not have fluff inside them, so if my puppy does rip it open she won't get cotton all over or swallow it. We've only had them for a few days, but the toys have been great and I am sure as she gets bigger she will enjoy some of the bigger toys.

It has everything she wants: plush exterior and a squeaker.  Even better, it is durable (we've had it over a month and no visible tears), probably due to the rope interior.

He always wants to pick it up in the middle though and it's a little bit hard for him.  If he grabs an ear or arm it's easier.
I gave it 3 stars because it came with a broken squeaker.  He plays with it anyway.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/frisco-plush-inside-rope-squeaking/dp/201415

I had almost given up on plush toys, but she loves them so much so after seeing these and reading reviews I gave them a try.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have 2 very large dogs (80 lbs and 110 lbs) and they are ruthless with toys. Most only last about 10 minutes and it feels like a total waste of money. These toys last months. It's not even that they're super indestructible. I think they just like them! They carry them around like babies. I'll only be buying these from now on.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These toys I bought because of they're looks. I just couldn't help but giggle looking at them! Being a stuffed animal - they are tough! THis toy has gone through so much puppy play and tugs it still looks new- no holes, stuffing falling out or anything (for now)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I purchased the gorilla version of this toy and it lasted months!!! This one lasted 15 mins before it was torn up... i was super disappointed</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Was a matter of hours and the abs of this toy was destroyed and had internal injuries.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Chewed rihnos head off with in the first 25 mins but the body last longer, keep in mind my pitbull is a stuffed animal destroyer. Still had fun with It though..</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is our second Frisco toy. We started with the gorilla, then recently purchased the rhino. My GSD loves to rip apart stuffed animals and take out their stuffing. That begins to get pricey, so we’ve been searching for a toy that could withstand his play. We’ve finally found that in the Frisco toys. We’ve had the rhino toy for about 2 weeks and he’s only been able to rip open the ears, keeping the stuffing intact, and the toy still playable. He’s very happy with his new toys, and anything that makes our good boy happy, makes us happy(: definitely recommend for high chew dogs!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Having two German Shepherds a plush toy was out of the question, until I found this! Don’t get me wrong, my male ripped off the ears and the stuffing from the arms, but he loves this toy!! Carriers it, lays on it, and is surprisingly gentle. I will be ordering more. It can and will be destroyed but it will last longer then most plush toys, so let your dogs enjoy!!</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/frisco-muscle-plush-squeaking-rhino/dp/201409

She doesn't chew on any of our wood framing, bookcases, coffeetable, or chair legs. She has a benebone she chews throughout the day and a a small kong squeaker. The search continues for a crinkly toy that is made to last a few months, at least.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Both of our pugs love this, we got it along with another for their 2nd Birthday.

I even hung it up and took a picture of him sitting next to it like it was his birthday balloon lol</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog has both size balloons. I added a photo to compare the sizes. The small one is beat up but it’s a year old. He loves these balloons. The big one has a squeaker but it’s harder to find. Can’t go wrong! It’s a squeaker toy and a tug a war toy in one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My mastiff thinks this toy is great.  It's soft, it crinkles, it squeaks, it has a rope on the end--what's not to love?  However, we do have to keep an eye on him when he's playing with it, as there is a loose bit of cloth at the edge of the balloon that he can tear easily if he chews on it.  As I think some others have mentioned, this toy might not be a safe choice for heavy chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a big chewer and loved her birthday present!

Within a couple hours, he'd made a small hole around the mouth, but I sewed it up and so far, so good.  And Rico's enjoying his new pal.

Two squeakers already came out and it was a good thing that both times my husband was there to remove them from the dog's mouth.

One of my dog does like the crinkly noise this toy makes, or maybe HATES the sound?  Not really sur, but she lunges at it when I crinkle it. My other dog HATES the LOUD crinkle sound

I will donate this to a dog rescue, since it just doesn't work for my dogs.  I still recommend it for larger dogs that want a hard crinkle toy.  Definitely NOT cuddly, so not sure what the word comfort has to do with this toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was a breakthrough for me. I have tried hard / soft rubber toys, rope toys, food filled toys, but my lil chihuahua just wouldn't bite. He actually likes this, though! He's very petite (3.5 lb), and can't really bite down on it too hard. I can see how a stronger dog could get through it, but this should last him a while!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Shepard is still young and full of energy most stuffed toys don’t last a day but he has somehow kept this one in tact. He loves to teeth and sleep on it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">First time ordering from Chewy. The Hedgehog toy is a great hit for playing fetch.  Was surprised to see its""bounce-ability"" that added to the fun.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Ralphie hasnt played with it yet. As he is still figuring his new family out. But it seems like a quality dog toy to me. I'm sure all the negative reviews have to do with how aggressive a player the dog is. My dog is a senior so I'm sure it'll get some snuggles but not be chewed much. I could be wrong. We will see when he is more comfortable and starts to play more.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">In five minutes this had holes torn in it. The fur and fabric are very thin. We had to open it up and remove all of the stuffing to prevent any ingestion issues. Sewed it back together so all the dogs have now is a flat fabric hedgehog to pull on. They loved the squeak and the paper sound but now no longer have that option due to the lack of durability.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have two extra small, very tiny Chihuahuas, &amp; they have a hard time carrying &amp; playing, with most small, &amp; sometimes xsmall toys, because of there size &amp; tiny mouths!   The toy makes a crinkle noise &amp; squeaks!  They have the time of there lives, running &amp; playing with these.  Perfect!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Although Kong changed the construction and this hedgehog no longer grunts, it is still my dog's favorite toy.  He has gone through several of these and loves them.  They are made pretty well; it's just that he will stop at nothing until he removes the insides.  Afterwards he still carries around the exterior for months.  Will order again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Very cute toy, well loved by my dog. The crackling sound had him chewing more energetically than usual (he normally keeps his stuffed toys just fine for a year or more, gentle with them). The seam split and filling came out on day 2. So cute toy as it is, I wouldn't recommend it for durability.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 100 lb Rottie loves her hedgehog. We don't let her play with it when we're not around due to the possibility of her shredding it to death but she loves playing catch with it. It's a challenge to find the squeaker so that's another advantage as it keeps her occupied trying to get a hold of it. It moves around inside.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/kong-comfort-hedgehug-dog-toy-medium/dp/236387

I have a Yorkie puppy 1.5 lbs - yes a puppy and I ordered this refill and three toys - the toys come with an extra squeaker - so a total of 12 squeakers and 4 days later I have 3 squeaker refills left the rest have all died off.  Play time is less then an hour per toy - so as stated these are terrible - Love the Kong Toys they are great, but the squeakers need to be drastically improved</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’m glad Kong makes these replacement squeakers available because my miniature dachshund destroys most squeak toys in 10 minutes or less. The small toys with the replaceable squeaker seem to last longer, but she breaks the squeaker in them every time. With that being said, the squeakers are really not very good quality because depending on how intense my dog is on destroying it, they may last for minutes or days. 
But with no other alternative for replacements they do the job.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Do not buy refills for the stuffed toys, the fabric toys are very durable, however these squeakers only last a few chomps. I have a doxie puppy and another doxie who loves the noise of a squeaker, they aren't rough, just playful and the squeakers got holes in them right away. 
This is a great concept, but these need to be more durable.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I save so much money by buying the only part of the toy she cares about. At the rate my girl chews through toys,  I can't afford to replace them as fast as she destroys them.  I rely on these to keep the play going. 

 At first I thought what would I do with these, I don't sew. But I quickly discovered effective non sew ways to use them.  Example 1:   Take old socks and quickly tied a knot to trap a squeaker in the toe.  Example 2:  Use JW Holee roller toys; you can slip squeakers into them like a puzzle toy.   Example 3: toss several into an old purse or bag and watch the doggie go wild trying to liberate them all like a game of hide and seek.   Just pick them up before demise so you can use</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Although the lives of our dog’s favorite small toys are extended with these replacement Squeakies, be aware that the squeakies are not durable.  They themselves have a very brief life at the mercy of our dachshund.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Ok, so my girl, Cleo, is a shredding/chewing/munching monstrosity- that makes me feel lucky because she drops rather than swallows each piece of toy she dismantles. I literally spend two hours at the end of each week, reconstructing her toys. These squeakers were purchased for that task. Right now we have a headless eagle (the wings still crinkle invitingly), a decapatated raccoon, and a hedgehog which are the favorites. Unfortunately, even with being wrapped in a special canvas pack, she punched holes through each of these squeakers immediately. 

Now, if your dog isn’t a tough a$s chewer like mine- and loves replacement squeaks, then get these!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My gal is a heavy chewer when it comes to squeakers!!  But 2 weeks into the replacement and I still hear noises!!  Successful 1</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My boy love this one toy but the squeakers broke. With these kong squeaker.

Sadly, I have stuck with Kong for my dog Bruce (just turned a year) since he was 3 months old. I was wary of making my first Kong online purchase because the in store toys are so amazing. Sadly, I should have listened to my gut! FIRST THING I noticed was how small this item was compared to his other kong toys. I understand it is a medium, but i didn't know that meant the quality would be totally destructible compared to a Large. Bruce is a 60 pound pitbull who usually takes a week-2 weeks to destroy a toy. Sadly, I wish I could have save him the disappointment with this toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I know my dog rips toys apart within a day or two of their arrival it I thought oh this has a rope inside so once he chews through the soft fur materiel the rope will last awhile.  I was wrong.  Not only did he get through the fur but he had the rope shredded within a day.  He enjoyed himself chewing it apart.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the 2nd one of this style toy we have purchased.

We were able to hold onto it for a bout a week which may not seem like a lot but for us was a MAJOR accomplishment. I also really liked that it didn’t have stuffing in it. My dog tends to choke on that so it was a relief that this didn’t have it. Our dog loved it. Definitely recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my service dogs FAVORITE toy after just a few hours!!! He loves playing fetch in the yard with it. Loves sleeping with it and chewing on it. I would not recommend this if your dog destroys toys. Bleu is not a big chewer and does tear his toys. Just knaws on them lightly. I plan on replacing if it gets destroyed. It is hard. But i love that. Its still soft and squishy but very firm and thats what my pup loves.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Good quality toy, but very hard! My pup has trouble chewing it. Also, it says there’s a squeaker in it, but if there is, I can’t even squeak it because of how firm this donut is. Not bad, but would definitely soften it to allow them to have an easier time chewing it</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this toy for my 7 week old wiener puppy, and it is almost the same size as her! She sort of likes it anyway. It is kind of hard and heavy, but I'd recommend this toy in size small for a medium to large puppy</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this toy cause I thought my puppy Kylo might enjoy something like this to chew on. Well, lets just say he enjoyed it to pieces. He is teething really badly right now and literally chewed a chunk out of the poor donut. It was super cute and durable while it lasted for 2 days. The donut will be missed but it sacrificed itself to save my furniture from puppy teeth. 

I think a dog with adult teeth would love this if they aren't a heavy chewer. Heads up for everyone the foam is the same color as the tan fabric so it is deceiving on whether or not the donut has been ripped open.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I wanted to love this donut so bad! But my 18 week old pup chewed the squeaker out in about 3 seconds and then there were pieces of this all over the house and I had to take it away. RIP donut.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is hardy! I have pup parties when my friends come over, and they have big dogs. I usually have to hide the soft plush toys that could be gobbled up and torn to sheds in a matter of seconds. Not this toy! It’s thick and has a good weight to it. It’s a little rubbery—which gives a good pull and tug, especially for playful pups. It also is quite humorous to watch a pup with a donut hanging out their mouth or even two of them fighting over the donut. (We’ve all been there before when it’s a gourmet donut. I’d say this is right up there for my pups and their fur friends.)

The fuzzy fur is very thin, like it is sewed in lines into the material which you can see throughout the entire toy. The fur sheds and pulls out quite easily. There is also several pieces of the material of the body cut and sewed through that hang past the fur, hard to explain, but they don't belong there and I had to cut them off.

The squeaker went first. I am very disappointed. They love playing with toys but are very rough on the toys so I have been looking for something more durable and thought this was is, NOPE, not it. Got them four, 2 gators and 2 dinos, the two Dino’s are broken. The gators are still hanging on. It has only been about a week.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My little guy is a 2 year old English Bulldog/Beagle mix; he had this dragon for approximately 20 minutes before the wings started to come off at the seam and a hole formed on his back where the wing once was attached. Now, I know that my little guy is far from gentle with his toys and that is why I got this one for him; I seen that it had Chew Guard and thought it may last him a little bit. The wings didn't start to become detached from him chewing; he was throwing it with his mouth, grabbing it and then he would shake it. I completely understand that he was shaking it hard but 20 minutes for the amount that this thing cost; really. Definitely not worth the money; they need to put this toy under</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Golden Retriever still likes this toy without the stuffing and wings.  Lasted a few minutes until she had the wings torn off and squeaker out.

This one has heard up for a few weeks so far.  He loves his dragon.  We will be adding more GoDog toys with Chew Guard.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This dragon is mine, as my pup got my other GoDog Dragon ...he'll get this one too in time :) GoDog dragons are the cutest (they look and feel like a plush baby toy), they're well made and have held up so far. They have one large squeaker in the body, the material is layered, as they have a sample of the layers on the tag.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Willie, a 45lb Cockapoo had the paw chewed off within minutes. The squeaker was next. Go Dog will replace 1 time and sent the big fuzzy ball .It is the only stuffed toy he has not destroyed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this toy, because of the chew guard for my pup that rips through all her toys. Whats the point in making the toy chew resistant when the yellow center of the dragons belly has NO reinforcement. My dog tore into it in 30 minutes. Waste of money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 25 lb chihuahua/terrier mix obliterates stuffed creatures without blinking. This toy withstood three weeks of solid, intense play before our dog tore three of the seams wide open. While it would gave been nice for the toy to last longer, this toy has withstood a crazy amount of abuse in the last three weeks and our dog carries it everywhere. We are picking up a couple more versions of this toy to have as backups. Well worth the expense.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I joke and say my basset mix puppy has scissor teeth, when she chews fabric it is in such a straight and precise line it looks like scissors were used. BUT GoDog‘s mesh fabric combination inhibits her scissor chompers!!

So if you have no intentions of actually playing with your dog don't buy this. You can save some money but buying a bone instead. I have an 80lb pitty who destroys ""durable"" toys like it's his job. He however hasn't destroyed this one yet and the reason why is not because it's ""indestructible"" but because when I'm done playing with this toy it gets put up until next time increasing it's usability. My only real complaint is that the holes are a bit small for my average</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">One of the best toys ever purchased!! We have a Dane that is an aggressive chewer and love to play tug o war!! This is fantastic!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Decent pull toy, I think ropes last longer for tug wars than this. He tends to bite on the edges of the toy more, and the seams are coming undone. He killed the squeakers in about 15 minutes of play time. He is a mild chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a very rugged toy, and my power-chewer hasn't put a dent in it in. But that's really all I can say for it. Too big and too ungainly for my girl. I wish I'd gone for a smaller toy for her. I'd recommend this item for a larger dog that is a strong chewer.

Pros:
I've had it for a few weeks now, and my 50-lb. adolescent foxhound hasn't been able to so much as fray the edging on it, which is more than I can say about any other toys she's ever had. That alone accounts for the 3 points I'm giving this item. 

Cons:
1) It's just too big and unwieldy for her. She's a big, tall hound dog with a long muzzle, so toys for ""medium sized dogs"" don't usually stand up to her chewing efforts, that's</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Labbies are very tough on anything, but the TUFFY ""pull"" toy is awesome and I highly recommend for the active pups !</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/tuffys-ultimate-tug-o-war-squeaky/dp/39288

It will be in his Christmas stocking and I know he will love it. These toys are sturdier than one might think. He gets pretty aggressive with them at times and not even once have I had to repair one. They wash in the machine and dry in the dryer and come out looking like new.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Super cute holiday toy I got for my large mastiff mix. She loves it and surprisingly hasn't ripped the squeaker out of it yet. I'm sure that will happen eventually, but I think this is a very well made product for the price. I would buy again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Purchased this item for my Irish Red &amp; White Setter about a month ago to have for the approaching Christmas holidays.  She absolutely loves the cuddly reindeer &amp; even brings the toy to bed with her. The item is durable enough for our games of toss/catch.  I expect this little reindeer to be around for many more Christmas days.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My chihuahua loves this toy. It has become his favorite. Although he has pulled lots of the fur off of it and the tail the squeaker still works.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Puppy had this for three days and barely touched it until this happened in a 5-minute timespan... we have had luck with all the Kong stuffies lasting, but not this one! Not worth the $10. Too bad, it’s so cute!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got the alligator version for my dog when she was just a puppy. It's been 3 years and she still hasn't torn it up! We also have the pink elephant version and it too hasn't been torn to bits. We decided to grab a holiday version for my sister's pit-mix who ADORES these toys but often tears everything to shreds. He can't seem to break this one apart! Big fan of these toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Well 10 days is certainly better than a couple of hours but disappointed in how easy it was to be ripped apart. Thought maybe the Kong would be tougher but sadly it’s not. 

The Moose is very cute though.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered medium size based on the description that it was 10 inches long. If I stretch it’s legs and antlers I might get to 10”. My Labrador like stuffed toys, but this is too small for him, he seldom plays with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Milo loves this toy! Durable, cute!

My 7month old aussie is obsessed with attention so I wanted something to occupy him when I cannot.  This toy is very affordable compared with other robotic dog toys and successfully entertains my puppy. It basically just vibrates and makes this sound like a barking + sniffing + whining puppy whenever it’s picked up.  Even though it makes the same annoying sound/vibration each time, it moves on the floor or bounces differently when it’s dropped and my puppy so far is not bored.  At first he barked at it non-stop, but after a day he stopped barking back at it thankfully.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We really wanted to love this toy for our 11month Bernedoodle puppy, but the crying dog sounds (as others mentioned) were definitely strange, and the faux fur material could have been tougher. The on/off button was tricky to locate. Tough to get the fur off the plastic ball. When I opened the plastic ball housing it was very greasy. Keeping for now but would have loved to put the cost towards a better model. The manufacturer should build a better one and charge a little more. The bouncing action is its best feature.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this in March, never turned it off or changed the batteries and it still operates as should. My girl likes to play with this especially when I put it in/under something or wrap it in her blanket challenging her to get it. My girl is easy on her toys, if she wasn’t I’m quite sure with her size and strength she would easily break the ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I thought this would roll around the floor, but all it does is make a terrible puppy barking and whining noise and kind of vibrate. My dog gave it the stink eye; we were both totally annoyed at it. Just so you know when you turn it on, you have to shake it for it to activate or else it will seem broken, seems like a lot of people thought theirs was not working...</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I can see why this would be fun for other dogs, but it scared the living daylights out of my 4 month old puppy.

He's not generally a fearful guy but something about this toy really did him in.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy was very cheaply and poorly made.  I could not get it to work at all after I unpacked it.  It was a total waste of money.  I was so disappointed in this total piece of crap that I just threw it in the trash can.

It was definitely a waste of money!! Not made good at all!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a fun squeaker ball. It’s fabric over a thin plastic inside. I was surprised that it was as thin a plastic inside as it was. Our dog crushed it while squeaking it but surprisingly it pops back up really well. It has continued to pop up anytime he’s played with it. He has a favorite ball and so this one isn’t played with a ton. If it was the only one he had to lay with it would have been destroyed already. He’d have bitten through the plastic if we weren’t playing fetch. I like to try different ones so he gets different stimulation. His favorite ball doesn’t squeak. So I tried this one for something different. And he played with it for several days then went back to his favorite ball. </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves it!! At first it was hard for him to hold it in his mouth which made it a game for him because he would hit it with his paws and chase the ball around.

I don't think this is meant to be a chew toy, so I don't understand the bad reviews...
It's a ball not a aggressive chewier toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">To be honest, I bought this for my niece who is a big Jack Skellington fan.   I don't think it would last long if I gave it to the dogs to play with.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy broke after 2 days of my dog playing fetch with it. He loved it at first, so for the price it was fine. It might be more suitable for smaller dogs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Fell apart in less than 5 minutes. Very disappointing.
If your have a dog who doesn’t get physical with a toy than I guess it would be ok.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I had such high expectations based on the description. It was very misleading. The ball is tiny, smaller than my fist. My 80 pound dog crushed the indestructible squeaker (the whole ball, actually) during our first game of fetch. I let him chew on it until the outer layer started to come off. We had a solid 10 seconds of fetch and four minutes overall. Not a worth while toy. Try your luck elsewhere.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">What a bad toy. Odd shape weird covering, no fun for my small dog or his medium size friend.

However, it is now day four and the toy is totally destroyed and there is foam EVERYWHERE. She has a lot of anxiety and is a chewer, and she takes it out on the donut. She loved playing fetch with it, slamming it, chewing it, ripping it.

He has a small mouth too, so he can't really get a hold of it. But its also pretty heavy. If you have a big dog (like a lab, pit or anything with a big mouth), this would be a great toy.

It's size is a little too big, but the real issue is how heavy it is. Definitely don't recommend for dogs under 30 lbs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Finally a soft toy that is hardy and the same time soft. The almost tough foam makes the toy actually sturdy enough to play with. It is a little heavy but it give me hope I won’t have to sew the thing together a hundred times like those cheesy, basically stuffed animal ones. My boxer and beagle love the small one. We bought a few. It does squeak but they don’t care when it bounces and rolls by.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 8 month old lab loves this donut. Bought it in both colors.

We have had dogs in the past and never this rooster. I didn't think too much about it, but our friend said it was her dog's favorite toy.  It soon became Molly's favorite and now this is the second rooster!  When this wears out (made so well, it took a year for it to wear out), I'll purchase another.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">While the rooster is adorable and is supposed to be for touch chewers, it's not very robust. Not even 2 hours after forking over the fowl to our rescue pup, he's already gnawed a hole in the poor thing and was spitting its entrails out all over the floor. Poor rooster.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have been buying these chickens for our dog for a few years now and the quality has gotten worse,  We realize that they will get ripped but the last on arrived ripped in the box (new brown one). chewy replaced it no questions asked but that one lasted only a couple of days compared to a couple of months before. Won’t buy it again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered these on Thursday and they arrived today. Our dog loves these chickens, but he had just about destroyed the two we had. We couldn't find them at our local pet store, but Chewy has them. I'm completely satisfied with the product and especially thrilled with the quick delivery. We will purchase here again!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Unfortunately, our long legged chicken didn’t survive 5 minutes with our Berner.  He had the factory tags off in a minute, the beak was gone after two minutes, and one leg gone within 15 minutes.  Pretty disappointing.  He’s only 8 months old.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered the ""Large Fat Chicken"" for my 6 month old Bernerdoodle puppy and he literally destroyed it within minutes. I was looking for a tough, soft chew toy and the ""Chew Guard"" feature seemed promising. Not so much. Within 30 seconds he had eaten the toes off of the feet and started pulling out stuffing. Then the eye...then he opened the back and stuffing everywhere. It seams that the ""chew guard"" is only the tan textured material on the legs, head and underside of the wings. This was VERY disappointing and I will be returning it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have purchased many GoDog toys and all of them except this Rooster have held up to my dogs ruff play. I gave Ruger the Rooster he shook two maybe three times and the back split open. 
I'm very disappointed!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a large breed dog that loves squeaky toys. He always breaks the squeaker within minutes of having the toy and then spends the rest of the time chewing the toy apart to get what made it squeak.  This toy really held up to his torture. This toy has five squeakers one in each appendage and in the middle area. Of course he broke the middle one within the first day, but the rest of them survived and he loves this toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I liked the brown skinny one a lot because my dogs had a blast with it so I ordered the white one to switch it up. They love new toys and will consider a toy of a different color new, but they sent me the brown one again and I never got the white one. No need for two of the same toys so disappointed in that. But good toy</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My SharPei loves her chicken, so when she passed away I was surprised that my tiny Maltese did too. It did not matter that as a puppy it was bigger than him. He just pulled it around everywhere. Just got another Maltese pup at 1 lb 5 oz she drags it around as well.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/godog-checkers-chew-guard-rooster/dp/179124

She is a scrawny 37 pounder, having lived on her own as a puppy in southern Colorado. She is a tough chewer. She was very attracted to this toy, but knew immediately how to rip into it. She is just a scrawny but determined mutt, so I don't know if the problem is that she has a super-powerful jaw, or that she is so darned smart she already knew how to repeatedly hit fabric until it breaks.

Highly recommend!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The Blue dragon while very cute is useless as a ""dog toy"".  A seam in the neck gave out within minutes of use.  White stuffing spilling out along with a squeaker device.  I can not recommend this toy for any dog as it will be destroyed in very short order</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">...I do own a crazy cat. Cat toys just aren't enough for him as he's larger than most common house cats. This toy has been his go-to since I got it and has taken the punishment he's dished out. Whether it's having its face, wings or other extremities bit or getting bearhugged and kicked repeatedly, this toy is holding strong.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Yes, my three year old grandson loves this dragon!  The dog never got a chance to play with this toy because the three year old grabed it first and enjoys making it fly around, and attack people. He also sleeps with it. Great toy, for dog or kid!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this because all the other toys from this brand have lasted months with my golden puppy. This toy lasted 30 minutes max. He was so excited at first and then immediately tore a wing off, both horns, and a leg. When the stuffing covered the floor he finally finished the massacre. But the head still squeaks! He tries to play with it still but gets dejected by the lack of substance. He still had fun for 30 minutes though. But thats like $2 a minute.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our Puppy is really tough on toys. Our older pup loves to play tug of war with whatever is new. This dragon has lasted the last couple days with constant playing. The wing has a small rip, but otherwise totally intact and worth the money.  Star is dozing with her dragon!  So cute!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My German Shepard loves this toy! You would think she’d tear it up but she doesn’t. She likes the crinkle sound the wings make. 
2 thumbs up.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 8-year-old son picked this one out for our great dane puppy. There are two squeakers in it I think, but the most fun part for the puppy is that the wings are crinkly. This one is made really well it's not like a plain stuffed animal. Stitching seems a little more heavy duty. this is already a favorite and every time it falls off of the couch the puppy whines because he wants it again!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bizzy and Dakota have used this toy for tug of war and with 60lbs on one side and 100lbs on the other this toy still looks brand new</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs love this toy! But keep in mind it’s about the size of a chihuahua, so it really seems to be intended for large size dogs!</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/frisco-mythical-mates-bluefoot-blue/dp/231101

The Snuggle Puppy is not a chew toy, it’s an anxiety-relief solution that’s designed to provide comfort and security for your little one. Dogs are pack animals and are instinctively drawn to their mother and others in their pack; the Snuggle Puppy recreates that intimacy with physical warmth and a “real-feel” heartbeat. The result is a calmer, more peaceful puppy that feels less loneliness, fear and separation anxiety.

The blanket has been perfect to use as he travels with us back and forth to work. Our pup knew exactly what to do with the toy as soon as we gave it to him (7 weeks). It's held up nicely. 
Definitely worth the splurge!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this for my puppy and I am sure it helped him sleep.

In just a week, he goes into his crate when he sees the stuffed pup come out. So it’s also helping train him to go into his crate. 
He also likes the blanket and toys. I just wish I could get him to stop nipping and gnawing on us. But he’s young and that’s just a training thing. 
I highly recommend this starter kit!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this for my new puppy, I love the whole set.

Cedar is one year old ACD, is very gentle with his toys, and loves squeaker plushies. This was perfect for him! He really enjoyed the hiding element of the toys, and he loves that there's more ""squeak"" than in regular toys (there isn't, but there's usually only one squeaker per plushie that he gets... in this, there's one in each of the bees). I make it more interesting by sometimes hiding a little treat in there or some more kibble. 

The only thing I didn't love was the tufts of hair on top of the bees. It does come apart very easily and I had to vacuum that off my floor, but that's</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We previously had a hide a pig in a little piggy house. She loved to chew on the house, so that went the way of all chewable toys fairly soon. She continued to play with the little piggies until they became so frayed that we worried she would swallow the squeaker.  That one lasted more than a month. The bumblebees fell apart faster--I think they were done in after a full week.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My small pup loves the hide-and-seek toys like this (he has multiple ones).  He's loving the little bees, but unfortunately either this specific unit had some manufacturing defects, or the quality of this particular product isn't so great.  The sewing on the tops of the heads of the bees wasn't very secure, so I ended up cutting/sewing the heads myself, as well as the one ""side"" on the inside of the beehive (that had stuffing coming out of both sides of it).  Super cute, just wish I wasn't concerned with how long it will last (especially with my pup not being a 'toy-destroyer' typically).</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I gave my dog this toy he was loving taking the bees out as I put them in then I noticed one of the bees stitching was opening and it’s fluff was out he had only for 5 mins before it started opening as he was playing. I expect toys to last a bit longer and with this you can see the seam came loose.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got the Outward Hound Hide A Bee Puzzle Dog Toy for my 19 week old standard poodle puppy. She loves it. They toy seems to hold up well to everyday play. It comes with 3 bee squeak toys that go inside the bee hive. There are three bee hive holes so the dog can easily get the bees out. My standard poodle puppy even likes to play toss with the hive. She also likes to wear it on her nose, she will stick her nose in one of the hive holes and walk around the house with it on her nose. We give this bee hive 5 stars. It is puppy aproved.

Then within another few hours (playing off and on) he had the whole thing ripped up. Very dissatisfied as I was looking for a good toy that would last longer than a day.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog loves this bunny toy. It entertains us more than her just watching her try to carry and drag it around. She hasn’t stopped playing with it yet. She’s fascinated with one end squeaking and the other “crinkling”.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have two dogs who love to play with these toys together. They are long enough that both of them can grab on and tug around. The crinkle and squeakers keep them interested. If you have a dog that's more gentle with toys, these last a really long time. When we just had one dog, one of these would last several months, with the squeakers still working. Now that we have more of a playful puppy around, the squeakers usually stop working after 1-2 days, but the toy stays in tact and they still like to tug / nose around in the crinkle parts of the toy. We haven't had an issue with our puppy ripping the toy apart.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is great! My dog absolutely loves it! Be prepared for some squeaking because there are three squeakers in it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 6 lb Morkie loves this toy. It’s double her size, but she’s able to drag it around and play with it!! Very sturdy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Siberian huskies love these!! They love the three squeakers AND the crinkly paper stuff inside. Very good quality. I bought two (duck and pig from Tractor Supply) this summer in July and they are holding up super well, but stopped crinkling and I’ve sewed small holes a few times. Bought a rabbit and a raccoon for Christmas treats for them and they loved them. Love these toys! They play tug of war with them too and we’ve had no issues.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The toy is better than we expected. It seems to be made up of durable materials and the squeakers seem like they’ll last a long time!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves playing with this big toy because it crunches like it has paper inside. She thinks she is ripping up a bag but it's only the toy which never rips. Very cute, I forget sometimes and think she has a bag.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this toy because it is built out of the K9 tiff material. My pups have a small toy made out of this that they have not been able to destroy. That’s not the case for this toy. Day two the stuffing is coming out.

Seeing all of her pictures made me want to get one for my Lab, even though his playing MO is to chew a new toy until he has punctured all the squeakers and then lose interest. Not so with this squirrel! Like my friend’s dog (who lives in England so they’ve never met), he treats the squirrel with kid gloves.

It is really well made and it has both a squeaker in the tail and a grunter in the stomach. My dog loves grunt ones, so she loves this one. Uses it as a pillow and I put it on different chairs in the house so she can ""hunt"" for it. On cold days when inside, it is fun for her to find it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pup Riley absolutely LOVED his new squirrel, the sound was fun and the tail and fluff was so appealing to him. Unfortunately it was made so cheap that he had the stuffing torn out within less than 24 hrs and he is not a tough chewer.

Wish it was made a little better since he was sad to see it go to the trash within 24 hrs.  :(

Wish they would send a replacement.....</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So, thought I'd try this squirrel and as soon as I removed it from the wrapping, he went ballistic. I was able to throw it 7-8 times until he went into killer mode and thrashed it, then, destroyed both the grunt and tail noise makers but, and this is only due to my not wanting to have to purchase another, making this a weekly expense, I've hid it, only allowing him to chomp on this toy when I'm watching. It's less than 4 days old and is sporting two large holes, missing stuffing, and the plastic grunt deal.

the edges (we got this at Christmas time).  He does take it away from her and gives it as a special toy so she doesn't have it 24/7.

The toy will not stay together even for one throw and fetch. The velcro on the first version was perfect, but with this one, the taco sometimes even falls apart mid-toss.

Some of his new toys last 1/2 an hour! He still his taco though he could tear it up in minutes and it’s been 5 days!! He is very proud of his taco and shows it off. It’s worth the price for the entertainment and fun that it brings but if your pup is an aggressive chewer think it through carefully before purchase.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My goldendoodle loves this toy!  He plays with it daily and believe me, he has lots of toys!

Not so much. In less than one day, our 7 month Australian Shepherd has chewed off parts of the ears. Very disappointed and not what I expect from KONG.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This poor review is by no means towards Chewy. I have only had great experiences with Chewy and will continue to order from Chewy. I bought this KONG Elephant suited for a large dog. I’ve always been under the impression that KONG has the best toys for dogs when it comes to destruction. It was a bit misleading. This was taken apart within two hours. My dog is a 40 lb, 5 month old labradoodle and I got this elephant for his post-neuter distraction. The very first day it had come apart. I am very disappointed in KONG. I understand all the toys will come apart, but I did not get my money’s worth out of this toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog is obsessed with this toy. He is bent on destroying each one as fast as he can.  Luckily they are extremely  strong  and manage to last a couple of months before he manages to get this teeth through to the stuffing. This time we bought 2 ( the 6th so far ) , . Taylor loves his elephants and we love how well made it is.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our puppy is really hard on his toys and we buy almost exclusively Kong toys because they last longer than other brands...except for this elephant. He had an ear off of it in five minutes and the trunk open with stuffing coming out within 30 minutes. Still love Kong, but wouldn’t buy this line of toys again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The toy seems well made and the material is tough but the squeaker didn't work right out of the box. I used my hands to search to see if it even had one inside it... it did have one in there but it didn't work at all. I contacted Chewy and they promptly refunded me because there were none in stock to replace it with. The toy gets a 2 star... chewy gets 5 stars all the way.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I purchased this toy along with another Kong Cozie Ultra for my labs. It was destroyed in minutes. I thought it would last since it was an Ultra and Kong is always so reliable but this was a total disappointment. Don't waste your time or money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Wanted a very sturdy toy for our pup (7 years old) who is very hard on her toys. In one day she had already chewed that red outline of Ella's leg/foot enough that the stuffing is already coming out. As a sewer I am always mending her toys. Was hoping this one would hold up longer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog would’ve loved this had it been fuzzy like a stuffed animal. It was smooth and hard though, I didn’t see that in the picture.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 6 month old Pitt mix had this toy for about a day before there was nothing left of the trunk and leg.

Therefore we keep the toys rotating and still let him splurge with stuffed Tuffys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this toy early on after I got my dog, not realizing just how rough she is with toys.  It didn't last long.  The first hour she had it she was ripping pieces.  She did, however, love it.  She ran with it, shaking it, having a wonderful time.  But, she also wanted to chew it and this is not a chew toy.  It wasn't long before she chewed open one part of the toy's mouth, pulling out a squeaker and all the stuffing.  Now it's just a bunch of strings.  She also started to mangle the top part and the tail.  Way too expensive of a toy for a dog who chews!

Combined with that being the squeaker location, my Mastiff mutt mix shredded it and got to the stuffing in under 5 minutes. I’ve had the toy for about a week. Bummer! And the rest of the toy is too tough for me to just pull the stuffing and sew the mouth shut!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Not as tough as they advertise!

Get something worthy of your pooch, and your money, and purchase something else. The company, ""Tuffy"" doesn't seem to understand what the word Tough means...

The Desert Phrog Dog Toy also has a protective pouch around its squeaker as an added safety measure in the unlikely event your dog gets to the core.

This toy is a little smaller than I had hoped. Not sure if size was posted and missed it, but my 68lb lab mix loves it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Tuffy's are the only plush-like toys that work for my cattle dog mix. She absolutely destroys anything else. They were originally recommended by my local pet store owner who actually said the local zoo will come by and buy big tuffy's toys for the gorillas to play with :') because they are so durable! Ive had a great experience. This frog in particular is great, its a little small so be careful with a larger pet. Overall, such great quality i highly recommend for any dog that is a destructive chewer but is eager to have a soft toy instead of hard bones</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog Ty absolutely loves plush toys, but sadly he tears them up in seconds. I love the Tuffy brand toys, but this one just didn't last. Ty got three days of enjoyment out of his little frog before the side seems ripped. He didn't even have a chance to try ripping into before it tore. I think this one ripped just from the pressure of his jaws squeaking it and squeezing it as he carried it around. Ty is a rottie/lab mix so he is pretty rough on toys, but other ones I have bought from this brand have lasted a lot longer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 4th Tuffy toy for my power chewer— all the others have held up remarkably well and he still has them. The frog lasted 15 minutes and stuffing was all over the floor— he went for the mouth, which wasn’t as sturdy as the rest. A lot of money.... wasted.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Tuffy is absolutely my favorite brand of tough plushies. I recognize that my girl is a deviant when it comes to tearing apart plush toys and Tuffy toys typically last between 2-6 weeks in our home. This guy, however, only made it about two days. 
Perhaps it was his tiny arms, ripe for the tearing. Maybe it was that Raven loved him too much right away. Whatever the reason, tough frog did not train enough for this tumble.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Just a hard little cloth covered thing from a dog's perspective.  Expensive and doesn't even have a squeaker. He'd have had more fun if I'd just given him the cash to chew on.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Well made toy that took my little (but aggressive) pup a very long time to destroy! Very happy with the quality!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I am impressed at the durability of this toy. My girl loves squeakers and plush toys but she’s not exactly gentle with them. Most dog plushies, even the ones labeled “tough”, have met a quick end— but not this one. It’s still whole and sound, after months of vigorous play and chewing. Not even a loose thread! Best of all I can just toss it in the washer with her bedding and it’s ready to go again after air drying. I bought a shark plush of the same brand and it’s these two toys she always brings to me when she wants to play.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Just what the doctor ordered - My 14 pound shih tsu loves it and can't destroy it</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves this toy, it's his favorite for sure.

She loves anything that squeaks &amp; each section of the caterpillar has a squeaker.  Long length &amp; lots of fun.

She rolls around with it and drags it wherever she goes. Toys that keep her out of mischief are my favorite. This one gets an A+.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 4yr. old American Lab is 125lbs and the large is a good size for her, so I'm sure the larger size would also work well for her too.
I purchased this, in place of the yellow duck plush toy (her absolute favorite) that was out of stock, and it's been a perfect replacement. 
She ripped through the green section of the Caterpillar on the first day, but after a few weeks she has yet to shred through any other part.  I'm hopefull that this will last a bit longer than the duck, since it has 5 squeakers and not just one single squeaker.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the best squeaky toy yet for my Cleo. The squeakier the better and there are many squeakers to choose from, so this is presently Cleo's top choice toy as you can see from the photo. She is not a toy destroyer, so I am hoping this one lasts a good long while. The right size for my size dog of 23 pounds - or larger dogs. Soft and durable too - but I would not recommend it for the dog that likes to squeak then eat the squeak.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Great squeak toy, does not have stuffing to pull out!

It was designed here but assembled in China! According to the label.I don’t call that made in the USA! 
The toy is cute but the squeaker lasted 1 hr. My dog is a Shih tzu.  The rest of the toy has held up. 
Chewys, I look for toys made in America by Americans, from design to the end of production. Please be truthful.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This carrot is one of the first toys I gave my 3 month old dachshund, and she’s chewed on it for a solid week. Even though she has needle-like puppy teeth, she is only just starting to put a dent in this toy. The squeakie is also holding its own. I definitely feel like I’ve gotten my money’s worth already.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I never write reviews but this is a must. My dog loves carrot toys and I usually have to buy them often because he destroys them. I purchased this one and even though it was a bit more money, I figured he would destroy it. Weeks, not minutes have passed and the carrot is still fully intact.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Oscar's only toy that he adores. He has other toys, but this one is the won he keeps with him most of the time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My wife and I thought the toy was hilarious and our dog loved it. The problem is the quality. It looks really nice and sturdy at first, but give a less than 10 pound dog an hour and the squeaker is dead and the stuffing is pouring out. We also ordered the taco which is also cute and the squeaker in that died just a quick. I imagine our little guy will destroy that soon too and he's not what I would call very destructive.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 1 year old goldendoodle was able to put a huge hole in this within a few minutes. He's usually pretty gentle and not one to destroy toys at all. Definitely wouldn't recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">20 minutes with my dog and it had a hole in it and he had access to choke on the squeaker.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Henry loved his new toy, it was a perfect size for him to pick up.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Most dog toys are made in China. I never really paid attention until my previous dog got cancer. I'm convinced the Chinese killed him. I NEVER give my dog toys from China, and finding toys that are certified non-toxic is really hard. That's why I was THRILLED to find this brand of toys on Chewy.com. One of the CS reps told me how to find them. Just search dog toys USA on the Chewy website. Daisy is getting peas and carrot for Christmas, and so are her friends.

All the skinny crab legs make it easy for her to get a good hold on the toy. Bright colors make it easy to see floating on the water. And even after a few lake/swim sessions the fur is still soft.

My cavalier is incredibly playful and immediately took to the crab. My mixed breed is a lot more relaxed and less interested in toys unless playing on his own, however, he took mild interest in the crab which is already more than most of the toys we own.
Since unboxing the crab an hour ago my cavalier has not put it down and we have already heard the squeaker probably a hundred times. This is a wonderful toy for older dogs and smaller dogs since there are many places to hold it. 
I will definitely be ordering more for my friends' companions.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog(s); especially my English Mastiff; absolutely LOVES ""his Crabby"".

He loves to shake it, squeak it, throw it around and just hold it. He is a happy boy. And we are from Maryland so having a crab toy is a MUST. ;-)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Chacha really loved this new baby because the squeaker is a different tone than she's used to and the size was perfect. But within 15 minute she started sneezing. So we hid it for about an hour and gave it back and she started sneezing again. This time it was almost severe and lasted a lot longer.

I've never seen him so excited or engaged with a toy before! He is obsessed with this toy. Every once in a while we put the candies back in the piñata and digging them out again keeps him occupied (a win-win). Another nice perk is that each candy fits perfectly in his mouth, so he carries them around our apartment with pride. We'll definitely be buying more toys like this for our pup!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This review is not written in a negative way regarding the quality of the toy, just as a caution. I think this is a very cute toy, our medium/large size (60lb) pit mix is a huge fan of the search and find toys but the size of the candy in the pinata, maybe size, maybe shape, she swallowed before we could stop her.

I bought the Kong elephant and it lasted about 2 weeks (which was acceptable).  This alligator lasted less than 30 minutes of play time.  The stitching on the belly came apart within minutes. I was able to sew it up with upholstery thread. Handed it back to her and within 5 minutes, she had the leg completely torn. Kong says it's ""ultra-durable"" and ""long-lasting fun"". Not sure if I agree.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pitbull Sweet T loves all of the kong Cozies. She seems to like the new and improved version even better.

My 1 year old vizsla destroyed it in LITERALLY 5 minutes. Turned it into fluff. He's a power chewer, and he eventually destroys every toy, but I've bought others from Kong and Tuffy that at least lasted a week plus, that weren't even advertised to be as ""durable"" as this toy. I'm sure its fine for a casual chewing dog, but if you're looking for something durable, look elsewhere.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our golden is what some might call an aggressive chewer and he's pretty good at locating the weaknesses of pet toys and destroying them, usually within hours.
Even the ""Toughest"" as described by Kong and other manufacturers. 
This gator after removing the white tag on the bottom has survived better than 2 days of constant play with both the squeakers and ""rattle-y thingy"" still intact. He hasn't ripped any seams, pulled off any ears, or amputated any limbs.  It's cloth is still intact and whole.
Kong might have finally found one that will last a week! Keep up the good work!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I love Kong toys but have to say I am totally disappointed in this toy. It only lasted 5 minutes before my lab tore it open. No effort at all. I thought since it was the Ultra it would be more durable but it wasn't. Total waste of money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog destroys any stuffed toy that he has ever had. Kong outdid themselves this time!

My dogs are not constantly playing with this either, but the only thing not easily destructible that I have offered them to which they have paid any attention.

This toy has lasted over an hour and a half of incredibly focused attempts at destruction. He managed to get one of the blue paws off, but that was about it, and it didn't open a seam.

I gave this three stars because of a couple of design problems for our toy: 
The squeaker and grunter were difficult to find, so it rarely ever makes the  noises it's supposed to for us.

He nibbles on it, clinches it in his teeth and slams it around. He treats it pretty rough and it's very much intact. I was concerned that it is so small. It may be a choking hazard for some dogs, but it works out fine for my dog.

Never saw a dog so excited to get a new toy, that was funny. However she managed to chew it in two hours... She normally isn’t a heavy chewer, she has had toys that lasted for months. Guess she absolutely loved it... to bad the quality isn’t what we expected it to be, it was quite expensive for a dog toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our golden is very gentle with toys, so I won’t speak to the toughness, but the toy itself is adorable and he loves playing tug with it (and us). The squeakers in the wings are sometimes hard for him to find, which is pretty entertaining to watch. Haven’t washed it yet, but some of the other tuff toys we have did okay in the washer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 6 month lab/Aussie mix had this thing busted in the p minutes</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is AWESOME.  Like all Tuffy's toys, it's hard to destroy.  Our dog destroys any soft toy unless it's Tuffy's.  She is so happy simply carrying it around, though be warned, it's HUGE.  Our dog is 55 pounds (not sure of her height) and when she carries it by the tip of one wing, she trips on the other.  Pretty amusing and she's always happy to play fetch or tug-o-war with Perry/Terry.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My golden retriever is a super chewer and toy destroyer. He loves this toy and hasn't destroyed it yet!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this for my 1-year-old Irish Wolfhound puppy.

He's a tough chewer, but this stands up to the test. He got it in June as a bday gift, and it's still around!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this toy for my Big Gurl because she loves to seek out squeaks.  As large as this toy is it has ONLY TWO SMALL SQUEAKERS; ONE EACH IN THE SMALL FRONT WING ON EACH SIDE.  I am so disappointed in this toy and would not recommend to anyone.  Again, as large  and as much as this toy cost, it should have been LOADED with squeakers; in the head, in the main body, in the underbelly, in the tail.....</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We've had a Trex for 9 months now (it's had several surgeries and is missing limbs, but is still a dogs' favorite), the Pterodactyl might just replace the Trex as the favorite.  Like all Tuffy toys this is well made and strong.  In the two weeks we've had it, I'm rather surprised my pits haven't torn out the wing squeakers yet (that happens, even in Tuffy toys).  The lack of legs means there aren't little spots for the dogs to focus on, and that means less intentional tearing.  I suspect that means this creature is in it for the long haul.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/tuffys-pterodactyl-dino-squeaky-plush/dp/39243

So frustrating especially because all these dog toys are so expensive.  Losing all hope there aren't any toys strong enough for my Lucy.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/outward-hound-fire-biterz-blue-footed/dp/143530

In fact if you pull on these hairs with your hands you can literally rip them apart- the hair fibers have incredibly low tear strength.

It squeaks and he can shake it around - it’s nice and softish too!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">For years I've stayed away from ""soft"" toys for my 2 Labradanes because they would destroy them within minutes of getting them, sticking to ""hard"" chew toys.

This one is longer than she is and she LOVES it, especially the two squeakers (head and middle). Sadly, she was unstuffing it in under 15 minutes. The textured fabric was no match for her tough chewing behaviors. I sew it back together and supervise play now because she really does love it, but if your dog loves to ""kill"" and dismember stuffed toys, this one isn't as durable as others we've tried.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I received this today and let me just say I’m very disappointed. In the few months I’ve had my dog, she’s only managed to de-stuff one toy and rip one other toy and that took weeks to accomplish. I unpacked this and gave it to her today and I kid you not she had it for like 7 minutes and took the stuffing, squeakers, and threading all out and apart. It was so cute too, too bad it wouldn’t even stand up as a children’s toy. Obviously she thought the toy was a bore too.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The dogs like it which is what I care about most.

HE really likes to destroy things. The first thing he did was rip out the squeaker. After that it held up relatively well until he decided to rip the spine off and all the legs. The toddlers also really liked it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was one of the first toys I ever bought for my puppy. I nabbed it up before I even got her, out of excitement for her arrival. It quickly became her favorite. She LOVED playing tug with it and chewing on the rubber nubs. The crinkling sounds and the squeaking always got her attention! Now, she is almost a year old, and it is STILL her favorite toy. I actually bought her another one when she was a puppy because I lost the first one (and found it later). It has held up through hours and hours of tug. Easily the best toy purchase I made for her. I accidentally bought her replacement at a large (she's a small/medium size girl at 30 lbs full grown) and I'm glad I did! It's so cute seeing her </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My puppy was so excited when this arrived. There is a squeaker in the head, silicone-like spines in two different places, it's crinkly, and SO LONG! The toy is very engaging and easy to get your puppy's attention with. We have been having lots of fun with it and are super happy with our purchase.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 40-pound mutt LOVES to destroy soft toys - I call it his therapy. First he rips the squeaker out, then systematically shreds the rest of the toy. There are a few sturdier ones that he hasn't managed to rip apart, but mostly just because he lost interest. With this toy he's doing something new - actually playing with it! He loves to shake and toss it, chew on the rubber spikes, squeak the head, crinkle the feet, and play tug. I'm not sure what about this toy makes him feel playful instead of destructive. It's longer than he is, so maybe he sees it as a pal instead of prey? :) We've only had it a few days, but I'm here to buy a backup just in case that destructive urge kicks in later, plus </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a cute dog toy but not durable at all. My dog is a moderate chewer but in less than 15 minutes the blue plastic scales were chewed off and there were a few holes. I wish it was more durable for the price. If your dog is a light chewer it is great if not do not waste your money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">He loves this toy and hasn’t Chewed any holes in it yet.  Wish it didn’t squeak or not as loud</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our Boston Terrier/Beagle mix enjoys destroying her toys.  This one actually gave her a challenge.  I think it would last for most dogs.  She enjoyed it while it lived.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I love this dog toy and my dog loves this toy it has lasted her a year and she is very destructive I give this a five out of five.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is by far the best money I've ever spent on a dog toy! My dog loves it and carries it everywhere with him! He will literally dig through the toy basket just to find this lizard!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">At this point 2 weeks in it’s still intact .

Our dog will only play with toys that are velvety plush like baby toys. The light tan fabric on the face is a soft felt type of material. It is a nice weight but discourage your dog from grabbing the face to use for hard tugging. Gentle tugging play should be fine. It has been for us. The rings on this size are large enough for me to grip and our dog to pull on the other side of just one ring when he wants you to tug close to his mouth.

The squeakier was next- day three !  He is still playing fetch with the Dino but the Dino has been resigned !  I don't think they make a toy he can destroy !  But, I must say, it was very entertaining watching him have fun.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this toy assuming it would be somewhat more durable than other toys I’ve purchased but nope.

Also, keep an eye out for swallowed pieces - she had considerably less fun with some of the hem when it was going out!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">When I read about this toy I took a chance and bought 2.  One is put up for latter.  Now they love this dinosaur.  It has a noise maker and the fin makes a crunchy sounds.

They can chase one another and sometimes steal it.  Our girls are 15 lbs. and 10 lbs.  each one will take it and the race is one.

Within the first hour, my huskies had already ripped the ear off and the other toy had a massive hole.

This very heavy toy should be a lot more durable and last more than 2 days.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Overall I think this toy is overpriced but made of a nice tough material that makes him work a little to get the stuffing out. My 2 dogs get bark boxes every month- you never know what toy they are going to like- he seems to like this one quite a bit. 


My dog chewed off the tail and the husks in the first hour of playing, and within a couple weeks of playing with it intermittently he seems to really like the size of this toy and carrying it around in his mouth BUT has eaten a big whole out of the trunk, has one eye and ear missing, plus a leg so I think the durability score the company gives is a little misleading. Also this is a toy made for dogs who like to chew- my dog that isn't a big</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was supposed to be heavy duty able to withstand chewing.

The tail is gone and the ears are chewed up, but so far, my jack russells haven't been able to get their scissor like teeth into the seams to rip the insides out.

He loved it... to death.  In just 24 hours.  Largest surviving piece is about 1"" square.  I grabbed the two large plastic squeekers as they emerged, before he could eat them.  I just now collected the debris and trashed it.  Only nice aspect, at least it didn't unravel into individual threads, like most soft toys, so clean-up was easier.  He did like it, and he carried around the increasingly smaller corpse until it finally got too small to chew.  Advertising touted durability, and that's what convinced me to order it, so I was highly disappointed.  No value for me.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Just opened this toy yesterday, Along with about 6 other toys opened, and this was the only one my dog wanted to play with. So I’ll say that is positive. My pup was very drawn to this toy and loved it, so much that I wanted to cut my ears of because the squeaker is the most obnoxiously loud squeaker EVER...... so better for dog play when the humans aren’t home!! The toy has held up decently for the amount my dog has played with it, but in less than an hour he’d already ripped through the bottom and gotten the bottom squeaker out. I had to take it away because of the noise so not sure how long it’ll take him to get the top one out. Not an awful toy but I probably won’t be buying again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is one of the only toys that has held up to months of tug of war between 2 labs. The destroy most toys in a day and 4 month later not a rip in this one, will definitely buy more of these once this one manages to finally give out. If you have multiple dogs that destroy toys with tug of war, this is the toy for you.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I usually love Zippy Paws products... I bought this cutie for my 9 week old Maltese mix puppy.  His bite is not strong enough to 'destroy' anything (yet!), but he does like to pick up his toys and shake them like a big boy.  He loves to lie on top of this toy when napping, and has given it many 'big boy shakes.'  Unfortunately, the fabric is starting to 'ball-up' and shed already - and he's honestly not that rough (yet). I don't know whether it's the grayish color that has this problem (as mentioned above, I have several Zippy Paws toys); haven't noticed this happening to brown, blue or red velvety toys. Otherwise, would have rated this higher.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog destroys almost every toy she comes across but not only are these toys tough (she had it for a few weeks before she got one of the squeakers out), but the squeakers are big! I hate the tiny squeakers. I worry that she will swallow them before I can take it away from her.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The toy is amazing but the squeaks are SO LOUD! The dogs fight over both of them, they need to have them both at all times, but we have to make sure we give them to them to play with when we are in the mood because the sound can be overwhelming.

If they were made without the squeaks, I think we'd enjoy them as much as the dogs but since they are made for dogs, I'm giving them a 4 star rating.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 18 month old corgi, Frankie, specializes in annihilating anything plush, with a squeaker, or with stuffing. Even Kong brand toys only last about 15 minutes tops, if I'm lucky.  

This toy has lasted a few days now, squeakers and all! He's obsessed with it, doing everything in his power to tear it apart, rip open the stitching, and get at the squeakers. So far, it's held up to hours of aggressive chewing and somehow still looks completely untouched!

Thank you, ZippyPaws and Chewy!

The material is very strong and the squeaker is still in tact.  I think it's a little to pricey but than you get what you pay for.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My heavy chewers (both 70+ pounds) easily un-stuff most toys.  I got the purple hippo from the same maker and they had that open and were un-stuffing it pretty quickly.  The pig is still intact, though I've been finding bits of fluff nearby and he lost his ears and tail early on.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My parents dobermans absolutely love this piggy, it still squeaks and it's very much intact except for the piggy's legs and tail. It's their favorite toy still even after two years. They sleep with them and are very protective of their piggy, they also have the hippo one. They dont even let us wash them sometimes. Theyll just bury them in the backyard until we forget about them. I highly recommend</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy seems very durable. It seems kind of hard for him to find the squeeker so he can make noises</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My German shepherd destroys toys and the squeaker usually lasts 10 minutes. Day 5 and squeaker and pig are not not destroyed. She loves this piggy.</span>]",stuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/smart-pet-love-tender-tuff-pink-pig/dp/182493

Unfortunately a few moments after she started playing with it the eyes were gone.  In less that an hour the center squeaker and the padding around it were out of the toy and on her bed.

But he also tore a hole in the ""reenforced fabric"" which turned out to be one layer and a dozen tiny triangles of fabric sewn together instead of one large peice reenforced by stitching.

He loved playing with it but the toy isn't so mighty. His Kong stuffed toy has lasted weeks with no damage.

I liked the concept and wanted it to work because my puppy likes them, but can’t find anything that holds up.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The happy face of this Fat Cat and the crunchy water bottle body was certainly appealing to my 10 month old golden.  However, her sneaky chewing style will find the weak point of almost every toy presented to her.  This poor cat was killed in a matter of minute when my pup decided the velcro closure which looked quite secure, instead was the sweet weak spot.  Gently chewing, she eventually tore the fabric and began to chew away the velcro.  Alas, Fat Cat was rescued before more damage to both toy and pet could ensue.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I love fat cat toys,they have always been sturdy and who can beat the graphics. Been buying them for 14 years now but as the hurl a squirrel , and Chuck a duck, that I also bought where made of the heavy duty canvas, this was not</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Newfoundland/poodle mix is absolutely obsessed with this. We got her a bunch of toys for her birthday and she picked this one up right away and was so excited! It seems like it’ll last for a while but she’s pretty gentle with her toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Every dog is different and has different play styles so the toy might be destroyed a little quicker than most. I have an 8 month Malinois/Lab mix and when I brought this home, he loved it! Even when it was time to replace the water bottle, he was still throwing it in the air and having fun! And he didn't even break through the fabric which was a relief for me. Get it and try it out. Even if they destroy it immediately, at least they had fun!!</span>]",unstuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/fat-cat-water-bottle-crunchers-dog/dp/53534

Literally after 2 minutes of my dog playing with it, the squeaker fell out. That’s the reason why we purchased another one is because our dog loves the loud squeaker. 
The previous toy that is identical to this one (it was purchased at a local store) never had this issue. Due to the pandemic we aren’t going into stores to limit exposure so that’s why we ordered this new one from Chewy. 

Pretty disappointed with this purchase.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I wanted to love this for my 10 week old puppy. He loves playing w water bottles and thought this would be better.  He broke it w/n one day and the plastic is easily chewed off. I expected more for the cost of this toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this toy mostly to mess with my husband, but our great pyrenees 3 months old puppy seems to enjoy it quite a bit. Yeah, it can be loud if the dog gets excited about squeaky toys, best hide it if anyone in the household is still asleep. It is pretty good for fetch and easy to clean off the slobber. Our dog is not a destroyer, not sure if it would have survived the excitement of our previous dog (labrador).</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My English Bulldog is OBSESSED with these! I bought one at a store once thinking he’d play with it occasionally. It ended up being his favorite toy! After a few months the squeaker quit, but he still takes it every where with him! I decided to buy him one in every color and was not disappointed. Overall, the toy is pretty durable, but the squeaker does not last very long. He doesn’t seem to mind though.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our mini-Goldendoodle chewed the cap of this bottle in less than 10 minutes. Guessing all the great reviews for this dog chew-toy came from the humans who like how it looks. Waste of money!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The squeaker already broke off and no longer makes a noise. I opened it 15 minutes ago and it’s already broken. Very expensive toy to already break.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Cute, but my dog tore it to shreds within 10 minutes of playing with it. The description says they are known for the durability of their toys, but that doesn’t seem to be the case.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This isn't as great as the tequila bottle (according to my dog) but I still think it's hilarious. Great toy for dogs who love a durable squeaky toy! Lucy is a bone mouth sharpei/boxer mix around 65-70 pounds.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">First toy we bought when we adopted our 3yr old husky and it is his absolute fave. Extremely durable with a loud squeaker that is indestructible. One of the only toys he hasn’t managed to demolish.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’ll start with the cons of this toy, because there aren’t many. The squeak is loud. So loud I had to hide this toy at night time lol. However the squeaker quit working after a few days. Could be the dog, could be something else. He still plays with it though. It’s made from a thicker rubbery material and he hasn’t punctured this toy whatsoever. He loves using it as a fetch toy as well.</span>]",unstuffed,plush toys,https://www.chewy.com/silly-squeakers-beer-bottles-squeaky/dp/39294

Otherwise fun to play with.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought 2 of these loofa toys for my puppies. They are a year old.

The material is soft and durable.  All the ear chewing has done nothing. I have had to wash this toy a couple of times and it has lasted. No squeaker on this one. Will definitely order again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have been looking for a crinkle toy without a squeaker inside and finally found it with this product!

They love the squeakers (which still work) and we couldn't be more pleased with the durability. Great toy! We haven't even had to give them this green one yet, but we have great expectations of it :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The toy is much bigger than expected but it’s made very well and the squeaker is super loud which our dog loves.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Love the look of this Warrior dog toy, but unfortunately my 10 lb puppy managed to chew through it within 15 minutes.   He got the squeaker out and now not one of our three dogs are interested in it.  Bummer!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog, Hamish, is a very aggressive chewer.  For some reason he has decided not to destroy this toy. He loves the squeakers in it and with all the use, it still works.  Squeakers eventually go after a lot of play but he still likes the doll and carries it around with him. So this is a winner for us. We now have three of them.

This ball entertains him (he loves to make it squeak), and so far, it's holding up very well to him chasing and grabbing it with his teeth.
