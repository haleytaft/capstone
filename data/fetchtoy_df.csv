Unless I’m getting him a toy that I know is gonna last, I typically buy him the cheapest ones since they won’t last more than 20 minutes. I thought  these balls would only last a day or two max, but we’re going on a week AND THERES NOT EVEN A DENT!! 

He absolutely loves these balls. They’re scented too which I thinks makes him like them even more- but we have an indoor one and an outside one since he cuddles this toy and tries his darn best to chew it. Also, it’s $4 cheaper on chewy than petsmart.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have 2 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. Only 1 of them is really into playing ball. The size of this ball is perfect for the one who plays fetch, &amp; I like that they are not hard plastic. My other one is the power chewer, so I still monitor these balls because he may not play ball, but he WILL chew it up, if left alone w/ it for a long period. The weight of the ball is just right for throwing it farther &amp; w/ a bit more accuracy. My ball fetcher will also entertain himself. When he paws at it in a certain way, it quickly rolls away, &amp; he plays fetch w/ himself.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our young pup loves this ball! She is an extreme chewer and does not play traditional ""fetch"". Instead, she loves to have the ball bounced so that she can chase it down and take it somewhere in the yard to chew. We have had this ball for about 2 months and so far no damage. It has outlived every toy other than the extreme medium Kong toy. The ball bounces high and is great for pups that like to pounce. The best toy we have bought for the price.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog was chewing tennis balls, ripping off the soft threads.  Then I got these.  He plays with them all day - either fetching or just chewing.  He's a very hard chewer but I don't think he'll ever destroy these!  They are the size of tennis balls and if they get too dirty or slobbery, they are easy to wash.  I would definately recommend these!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 1 year old pitbull/husky &amp; usually she can go through a tennis ball in 15 mins. Decided to try chuckit! &amp; so far it’s going great. Good bounce &amp; very durable. No holes or teeth marks at all. I chuck the ball in the basement all day &amp; she’ll bring it back looking like it did the day I gave it to her</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Small enough for little mouths of Yorkies. We don’t chuck them, we just bounce them around in the house and the girls chew on them. It has helped with the plaque on the canines, which is a bonus. 
Drawback...
They roll easily under chairs and couches. We are fishing them out several times a day.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Golden Retriever’s favorite toy is his Chuckit Ball!    He sleeps with me and his 4 Chuckit Balls are always there too!    He loves to chew on them and they never show wear or tear!  He is actively 3 years old and loves to run fetch his Chuckit Balls.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 4 year old German shepherd is obsessed with these balls! She loves to play fetch and is almost always carrying one of these around with her. These are the only brand of balls it takes her a while to bust up. She is a power chewer and nothing lasts forever, but these are worth it bc she gets a few months out of them!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pup destroys even the seemingly most durable toys and this ball has survived its first day unscathed. She has spent a few hours working on it and no marks yet. I give this my highest durability rating for being able to survive a single day- that doesn’t often happen with new toys here!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">They never seem to get old! VERY durable, colorful (so you can see it when it gets tossed under furniture) and the right size for a Cavachon to get his mouth around. When they get lost and I order new ones, he's SO pleased with the Chewy's box!!</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/chuckit-ultra-rubber-ball-tough-dog/dp/38371

LOVES it.  We accidentally cracked it on the concrete so it took me a little while to order another one.  She watched me take it out of the box and started jumping up and down.  She loves this ball more than any other and it is chew proof.  I have to hide it inside so she doesn't play soccer with it in the house.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy will keep your larger babies busy for hours.  My boy, Max, loves it.  He will chace it for as long as I will let him. 

The nice thing is it is sturdy and tough.  It won't break easily and last for as long as you take care of it (example: don't run over it). 

My recommendation, if you have a larger dog that likes noise you should buy this for them.  It will be the last noise maker you'll every buy or want to buy for them.  They will love it and you will enjoy watching them have fun with it.  Worth every penny.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pup is a chaser so I thought he would love this. He will chase literally anything normally, even light reflections. However, he did not know what to do with this ball! It became more of a nuisance having to move it around to show him what to do verse a fun activity for him to play with unfortunately. I think there are better interactive toys out there Chewy has to offer than this ball, especially at this price.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 5yr old 125-130lb female Rottweiler liked the noise but upon giving to her and making a 5min phone noticed she destroyed the toy and had to throw it away. It's NOT only this toy as she has Incredibly Strong Jaws and has destroyed 90+% of the toys I bought her. I was hoping from other reviews that this might last but it did not survive the 5min Ana Dog test, I guess it's back to drawing board.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a pitbull and he seems to amaze me with how fast he tears toys up. Literally in 5 minutes he normally shreds toys but this one he’s having lots of trouble destroying lmao.. he’s so excited each time it moves and makes a sound 10/10 recommend if you have a big playful dog who seems to destroy everything. This is the toy for them!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our older lab couldn't care less, our little Pomsky is afraid of it, but our Corgi just goes wild over it! She looks toward the cubby hole where I store it each day when she thinks it's time to play.  I put it down on the floor and she chases it all over the house, pushing it with her nose and barking the entire time.  She only stops when she needs a drink of water or she's just exhausted.  If you have a dog that loves to play and isn't afraid of crazy, wacky sounds, this might be the toy you're looking for.  It seems to be well constructed too, so I expect it to last a while.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 16-year-old Jack Russell mix is mostly blind and deaf. However, he still likes to chase his toys and play with them by himself.  He doesn’t know what to make of this toy. He responds when I roll it, but just sniffs it and walks away. It seems to be too large for him to move and the indentations are too far apart for him to get his mouth around, so he can’t pick it u.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a fun ball for my hyper chewing puppy/dog. At first he was afraid of the sounds, but the more we laughed, the easier it became for him to play. It rolls really well on wooden floors and speaks sounds, sentences that seem to be echolalic. My pup loves for us to play soccer with him and sometimes as he’s zooming, he plays with it himself. It’s a fun ball for him, but it is heavy and not made of material for him to chew.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 8 months old female German shepherd/mastiff mix loves her ball. She enjoys throwing the ball, in the air, and rolling it down the hill. The ball seems to be waterproof, as we have forgot it outside, and it was rained on for a few days.  We have chucked this ball, and it works perfectly fine. This ball helps our dog, enjoy playing by herself, to gain independence.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Ah, no vidéo. Only allows photos &amp; that’s not fun. My terrier wears herself out playing with this toy. She barks &amp; growls. I think it’s because of the various noises. A great investment. She’s only 23 pounds so took her a few days to figure how to carry it in her mouth, but she did. Proudly. Now Mom has to go fetch if it ends up in the bedroom under the bed.</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/as-seen-on-tv-wobble-wag-giggle-ball/dp/131879

They last a long time, but you do need to toss them when they start to come apart, which is why I’m buying his fourth one.  He seeks it out above all his other toys.  He even has it near him when he sleeps.  It’s very cute.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My large male German Shepherd absolutely loves this Kong ball.  I have to keep it outside, otherwise, he constantly rolls it under the furniture in the house.  This ball has great bounce &amp; a squeaker that absolutely puts his ball drive in overdrive.  Have had this particular Kong toy a month or so &amp; he hasn't come close to destroying it, the squeaker still works!  Buying another one so my lab will have one to play with too &amp; she normally isn't interested in toys, but loves this one!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">First off, I probably should have gotten a large. The medium is smaller than a baseball. It was a good size for my puppy to catch but we have bigger balls that don’t roll under the couch as much. The squeaker is a good noise level (Kong really knows how to make squeakers that aren’t absolutely annoying). The squeaker lasted decently long as far as squeakers go. Once that broke it took a long time for the actual toy to break (maybe a month) he eventually broke the seal on one end. Luckily it only has one piece that falls out. It was thrown away then. As far as they go this one lasted my puppy toy destroyer a while. In the image you can see where the big ring is is where he eventually destroyed</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have two dogs: an Australian Cattle Dog and a Pitty and both LOVE squeaky toys but Mommy hates the 5 seconds they usually last in our house and sticking her hand down their throat to pull pieces out BUT THIS TOY SURVIVED THE WRATH OF MY DOGS. Honestly I was expecting the toy to last maybe a day, but they managed to last for around 2 weeks with the squeak intact and a month without any wholes chewed through. 

There is no such thing as an indestructible toy, but this was is extremely strong and my dogs are absolutely obsessed. My 14 year old cattle dog is now acting like a puppy and does not put this toy down. I have never seen him so happy in his life! I am going to buy a bunch more.

FAVORITE</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Ball seems durable and well-made.  4 month old puppy that is an aggressive chewer who tends to fixate on shredding on destroying toys.  Now for the downside... this ball might have, quite possibly, the most annoying squeaker of any toy we've encountered.  This ball would be best suited as a gift for a pup in your extended family and kept out of your own house.  Save yourself the headache and let the joy of this ball be spread elsewhere!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog, a 60 lb. Springer Spaniel, loved to self-play with this ball, including chewing/squeaking it. However, within 2 weeks, it stopped squeaking and the disk sections on the ends of the ball started separating from the main section.  Perhaps this ball would be good for ball tossing play, but not for self-play because of the chewing involved. My dog does well with the KONG Squeezz Dumbell.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 110lbs Rottweiler mix loves this ball (second only to the ball inside of the wubba when all the fabric is ripped off). It is probably the bounciest of any ball I have ever bought him and is every squeaky, which he loves, and is less of a high pitched squeak than other toys, which I love. He is not an aggressive chewer so I can’t speak to durability. I got the medium which is about tennis ball size.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I love this squeaky ball! The bounce is great and the size is perfect for my mini doodle. All the other squeaky balls my 20lb doodle has broken the squeaker in the ball or squished it so hard the seams pop. This one lasted about a month before he knocked it off the side of our balcony.  I’m now having to buy another one!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball is great!  It squeaks when it bounces and seems pretty tough.  I got the dark purple color (which I was hoping for!).  I will admit, my dog probably doesn't like this toy as much as I do, but he's very picky.  He may like it more as time progresses.  I'd get this ball again, though I'd probably get a smaller size.  Very nice ball!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This has become one of her favorite outdoor toys &amp; we couldn't be happier. Our 2yr old Rottie-baby loves to play, but gets bored playing catch/fetch quickly with some toys, but not with this one. Always time to play with this ball.  We've never left her alone with it, so she hasn't had the opportunity to shred it. Tough enough for an 105-lb Rottie!</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/kong-squeezz-ball-dog-toy-color/dp/38509

These last the best, and he always gets very excited to get new ones and take them on his walks.

Thanks, Chewy!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have 4 very large dogs. These balls like most I typically buy were not expected to survive long. Not only have they survived for weeks, but we have to hide them so we aren’t pestered non-stop to throw them. This is their focus rather than chewing them apart.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These balls are great, except for the fact that the squeaker breaks very quickly. This surprised me for a Kong product. Not sure if my dog is just especially gifted at breaking it, but I get about 30 mins of squeaking and then she is able to somehow break the squeaker. They are not expensive so I just keep buying more.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">For some reason these are the only toys my dog doesn’t destroy. Not sure if it’s just because balls are his favorite toys or these Kong balls are indestructible. Either way I’ve bought several of these over the years, and my dog is obsessed. One in each room, he eats with one by his side.

They are durable &amp; don't come apart like most tennis balls do.  Not lots of fuzz coming off of them either.  Our adult golden has the large ones.  Definitely my favorite tennis balls for golden retrievers!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought one pack of these for my ten week chihuahua and she loved them so much, I bought two more packs so I could have them in different parts of the house.

My dog is a big chewer, but these have managed to last several months (we also try not to leave her alone with them to chew on).

The problem is, after about 30 minutes of play, the squeaker dies and the ball becomes a foamy, wad of rubber and felt. In a mad attempt to get the ball to ""squeak"", he will keep chewing it, until it falls apart and then he shreds it. 

I tried out this Frisco brand and was pleasantly surprised! The squeaker is very durable (and even louder) than the Kong brand. When I had the toys in a pile together, he actually chose this ball every time. So not only do I approve, my dog does too! The longer that squeaker last, the longer the toy will survive.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Super tennis balls, perfect size, bounce but not too much, float in the pool - colorful so dogs can see them.

So far they haven't split down the middle as other tennis balls have done! KONG, if you're reading this, make these balls in blue or red color!

(She also really likes the squeaking!) She is recovering from surgery and sedated but still somewhat playful at times and was in one of those moods. So I took this large squeaking Frisco ball out of the package and gave it to her when her last tennis ball (not a Frisco, just a promotional product) broke into several pieces, and I noticed about two minutes later that the squeaking had stopped. I looked up to see if she needed my help getting it out from under the couch, as this is a typical dance we do with any/all of her balls, and ‘</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Someone gave me a pack of these tiny squeaky tennis balls. WOW! My dog loved them, but my daughters dog went berserk!  The squeak comes out easily with an excited dog, but not before they have days of fun. Even after that gets removed the fun goes on and on. Love this lil toy and the price is perfect. I don't mind getting with my routine delivery!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog immediately knew this was his toy and loved playing with it. Chasing, chasing, fetching.

I might still buy again for a one day treat but watch closely.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My lab loves these. I have them on subscription delivery because he’s a lab and his toys don’t last long, lol. But these are durable and affordable. I think the squeaker distracts him so he doesn’t rip the hide off them. They are big enough that I don’t worry about him accidentally swallowing them</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a pit bull mix and this is her favorite toy. She has had one for over a month and it is still in one piece. That is saying a lot considering she loves to take her toys apart and she is constantly chewing on it to make is squeak. I have now bought a few more to have around in case we lose the other or for when it does eventually stop working.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is one of the best tennis balls I bought for my dogs. It's a little larger than a real tennis ball and seems to last. Usually within a day my dog haven't bitten in half. With this ball been 2 weeks and now nothing has gone wrong with the squeaky toy doesn't squeak. I'm very happy</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The first time I order this small tennis ball, it was by accident.

She still loved it after. This most recent one 2 chomps in and the plug and squeaker popped out whole. It was not ripped or tugged on. She had it in her mouth chomped 2x and popped her I side her mouth. The plug for squeaker you could clearly see barely had anything holding it on there. She was so sad when I had to take it away.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">One of the reasons I bought this ball “Chuckit! Ultra Squeaker Ball Tough Dog Toy” was because of the squeaker.  However:  While the Squeaker  was nice and really loud and my dog Breeze REALLY enjoyed it I would have to say that it didn’t live up to its name.  Saying that to say that the squeaker lasted every bit of 5 minutes.  Such a disappointment so now it makes a squishy sound and defeats the purpose and Breeze pretty much ignores it.  Breeze really loves the squeaky toys but their almost always a disappointment because they only last a short time and then the thrill is over.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These are my chihuahua’s favorite balls for fetch! He’s a sucker for the squeak and the rubber is great. He doesn’t like the fuzzy tennis ball ones for some reason, and frankly neither do I since they just attract the dirt. I would love to order more but they are now over $9 for two small ones which is insane! I bought my 2 pack for under $4. Hopefully they will go down in price at some point.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog absolutely loves the Chuckit balls and we have had all the different ones offered (large, small, squeaker, glow in the dark).  The most recent squeaker balls have not held up the Chuckit reputation. One day in and the squeaker came detached.  Could have caused a serious choking issue.  Sadly disappointed in this specific ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a GSD Malinois mix who is VERY VERY chewy. He also needs squeaks to truly de-stress. This ball holds up to all he gives it -- it is his indoor chew ball which means all-day play and it is still going strong a month into owning. (We use the XL non-squeak for playing ball outside) I've ordered more in case we lose it, not because it was falling apart. Definitely worth the money!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My young greyhound is a squeaky ball destroyer, so I buy toys that claim to be rugged or indestructible. The squeaker lasted literally 9 minutes. After a several of hours of play, the surface of the ball is still intact, which is lovely, compared to most other toys I've gotten for her. The ball has a nice high bounce and she loves chasing it.
The good news is that it is easy to find inexpensive replacement squeakers on the internet. For this toy, the ones listed at 15-16mm long are the right size. Weirdly enough, the replacement squeakers often last longer than the original.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My heavy chewer has gone through so many toys! Some toys, which advertise for heavy chewers, I’ve had to take away because she destroys them almost immediately. This toy is her new favorite and I feel safe leaving her alone with the ball. She carries it with her everywhere. Great purchase!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My siborgi puppy loved his small squeaker ball and when that one got too small for him, we sized him up to the medium and he loves this one just as much! Have found that these balls are very durable and good for indoor as well as outdoor play. Definitely worth the money!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have been pleasantly surprised out how long this ball has lasted with our 2 destroyers.  They love playing with this ball around the house, and have not even tried to chew it to death.

It no longer squeaks or bounces and is basically useless for the extra money I spent on it. My dog didn't even get to chew on it yet, we only played fetch once.

I wish it had more, and deeper texture so he could get ahold of the sides.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought the medium size, which is only 2 1/2 inches. I thought this would be a perfect simple toy for my Yorky to play with and squeak. He doesn’t like a ball that won’t squeak. The thing is, the plastic/rubber is so hard, it’s impossible for him to actually squeak it. He gets excited when I squeak it with my hand, and he chases it when I roll it, but that’s the end of his interaction with it. I would not recommend this toy unless you have a bigger dog with real strong jaws.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Great Dane is almost 3 and still acts like a puppy as large as he is.  He still chews on everything.  This toy seemed strong and would last.  Auggie’s attempt is to always get out the squeaker and he was successful immediately!  The seam came open real easy for him and he got his prize.  He hasn’t chewed off the ball yet.  It still is a strong material but I will give him another couple weeks till he starts ripping the material and swallowing it.  That’s when we have to throw it away.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a Jack Russell who spends his days chasing this ball my Australian Shepherd steals it from him and chews on it makes it squeak incessantly they love it nice durable ball can’t get the squeaker out would definitely buy this again</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">He is an aggressive chewer and has had this for two months and still hasn’t punctured it.

Of course, they all end up carrying around each other's toys anyway but it's the thought that counts! This football is extremely popular with three of my dogs not only because when you throw it, it bounces and is crazy but because of the wild squeaker inside. The ball is thick and sturdy and has yet to even get a tear despite our one heavy chewing dog. They love to be able to give it a hard squeeze with their teeth to produce the long drawn out squeak.

He tears the covering off of it when he gets bored! With all that I’d have to say this ball has held up better than most. My only complaint would be that you never knew w how long one is going to last. Sometimes the squeaker stops working, it will split at the seams after a few days.

But my doggo loves it so I'm a happy momma!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So I read everyone’s reviews and then I researched Kong toys. Well I am extremely disappointed with.

Within the first 5 minutes he started pulling the fluff off the ball. As you can see,  the ball is almost de-fluffed and he's still loving it. The squeaky started out very loud and obnoxious (for us, he loves ""squeak, squeak, squeaky"").  Now the squeak sounds like a dying rodent and he's still having a blast with it. I'll probably buy him a new one when this officially dies.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog shredded it under 2 hours.  I ordered 5 different Kong products.  He picked others to play with at first.  But when he started on this one he destroyed in under 2 hours.  The fuzz is too easy to be pulled off.  Once they have it loosened they break it open.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog ripped it apart immediately not tough. The ball was the skin was ripped off of the ball pretty much scalped the ball and I don't even know where the rest of it went but it's okay she rips apart everything I think she thinks it's fun well it is for her</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog likes all the Squeaker Kong balls and we normally give her the XLG size of the standard ball, but we tried this one to give her something new and it didn't last a day.

I wish sizes of toys were a little more clear...if I search for ""extra small or toy breed toys"" I want to find toys that would work for that size of dog.  I do like the toy though - size and price was good for a solid toy.  Kong toys are very well made and last nearly forever.

Teddy is a fetch/pursuit, tug-o-war, make it squeal fan, so this is perfect for him. 3 months and still going strong. Because he’s very active with this toy I couldn’t get a shot of him using it.

We can still play tug of war and fetch with it, but he loses interest pretty quickly since he constantly tries to squeak it and nothing happens.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy was brand new two days ago. Within minutes, my dog had the top seam ripped open and in less than an hour had completely exposed the small tennis ball and bitten a chunk out of it. I removed the ball and tied off the top with one of the seam threads. This seems to have slowed the destruction of the rest of the toy. (A month ago I ordered a Wubba Ballistic Friends toy that met a similar fate.) But my dog LOVES these toys! The legs seem to withstand his harsh treatment. Wubba should make an ""octopus"" that has the squeaky ball in the middle with legs on each end. Something that is still throwable, but will stand up to power pups like mine.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">i had to return this toy as within days the squeaker broke (and no fun for my dog without a squeaker!)  she is not rough on her toys and she played with it a bit - but not very much - certainly not enough for the squeaker to stop squeaking.
i have another one that has done great with lots of play - and my dog really likes the toy - so i'm thinking this one was an outlier!  chewy was great and refunded my money without question.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I usually like Kong toys but do not purchase this item for a strong chewer or a dog that likes to Play rough.  This would make a great fetch toy if it is taken away when the game is over, or if it is purchased for a smaller dog. For mine, the squeaker top was popped within 4 minutes of arriving and the top ball was chewed out and in peices by the evening. The next day it looked like a string headed octopus :(   It is really frustrating spend a lot of money on toys that don't last more than a day.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We got our first kong wubba today, Luna is in love. It was the first thing she wanted out of the box. It can do all her favorite things, fetch, tug, and squeak! It seems durable; she can be pretty destructive so we will see how long it lasts. For now she is thoroughly pleased.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Going to order again. Maybe poor or defective Kong toy. In 1 day rhe top of one toy was chewed open and exposed the tennis ball. Another kong toy was shredded on the tassel part. I have purchased these before and they have worked great.  I'll give the Kong toys one more chance.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My ~4.5 month Catahoula mix loves this toy and it’s help up to the incessant chomping of his tiny shark teeth. It is one of his favorites! The squeaker is not as high-pitched as most, which I appreciate. Read about this toy for Catahoulas on reddit and am not disappointed.</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/kong-wubba-classic-dog-toy-color/dp/38583

We wouldn't recommend this unless your dog spends 99% of her time outside in complete isolation in the middle of nowhere with no souls within a 5 mile radius.

There are no punctures or tears showing on the ball, but the squeakie died after a particularly enthusiastic squeaking session. I can barely squish this ball with my hand, so it's pretty strong; I don't know if the squeakie got mooshed just the right way to stop it from working or what, since I see no damage on the outside. Oh well. Back to the drawing board for Rottie-proof squeaky toys. Sigh.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves Kong toys! A ball is his most cherished toy and the Kong ball is by far his favorite. Being a German Shepherd he will stifle that squeaker in less than an hour and the ball itself gets pretty ragged and will last about 2 weeks at best. We will continue to purchase them but only when we do an order because it’s “special”. I only wish it would last longer :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was a fun toy for a couple of minutes. I thought with it being larger it would be more durable. But our bully breed foster chewed it apart in less than 30 minutes.  I don't necessarily blame the ball as much as I blame our dog.  For fetch this is probably fine, but any chewer, pass.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I can't understand how these have such good reviews.  We bought many packs of these because our dog loves playing with them, but the squeak stops after 15 to 20 minutes of play.  The plus is that they work with the chuckit's and that's about it.  

Our dog will squeak the ball a couple of times when he's running it back to me and then drops it, so it's not like he being overly aggressive with the biting and still they stop working.  We actually had 1 recently that made it to the second day of play (only 15-20 mins session) but stopped working after the first or second throw.  

I wrote Kong about this and they sent me a coupon which is nice, but doesn't address the fact that their product</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 18 month old golden retriever LOVES squeaky tennis balls, but they always get lost under furniture.  I ordered this on a whim and it has been a hit.  It is really large, but does not get lost anymore under furniture.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">When the neighbor dog barks at mine from over the fence, instead of barking back my pup picks up his Squeakair Ball and squeaks back.  It's quite hilarious.  He also loves to play ball with it, run around the yard with it in his mouth and chew the fuzz off after it stops squeaking.  The only reason I don't give this a 5 is because the squeaker give out rather quickly.  But, that might just be my dog.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves them and don’t wear down his teeth like regular tennis balls, but recently on all of the ones I ordered, with in 1 day the felt covering comes off or ball splits on the seam and is broken in half, my dog is almost 8 years old and he only catches them he doesn’t chew on them, poor quality, Kong’s used to make good products but not any more</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">my two shepherds love these Kong squeakair balls.  I have about 8 of them all over the house and yard.  They last awhile, but my dogs are not big chewers.  Each ball has a different squeak sound and the two of them pick their favorite.  I have other toys for them, but they always want to play with the Kong balls.  They like the med size ones.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I didn’t realize this ball was so big.

If/when he needs a new one, I am coming right back to this!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 125 lb. Lab/Great Pyrenees mix destroys most toys...but not the Kong brand. I buy the ones meant for tough chewers, and they stand up to his teeth! He loves balls, and this has become a favorite with him. We have a long hallway, and I roll it like a bowling ball for him to chase...great exercise!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have had quite a bit of trouble finding a ball toy that our boy can chew on and fetch with that he doesn't destroy quickly. So far, this has been amazing! He has chewed on it and thrown it all over the place and loves it! We put a small treat inside it and he loves the game involved with trying to reach it. This ball is incredibly strong, and I don't have to worry as much about it breaking into pieces. 100% reccomend!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our golden doodle absolutely loves this ball! It is definitely her favorite toy. She prances around the house with it all day and constantly chews on it and it doesn’t even have a blemish yet.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Don't waste money on knock-offs. I was concerned about cost, when in reality I probably spent four times as much in balls that didn't last.

Almost immediately after giving it to my dog, I noticed there were breaks in the rubber and it was coming apart. We did not fetch or tug with it, my dog was just running around the yard carrying it and pushing it around. It wasn’t completely broken, so we shoved a chuckit breathe right ball inside to keep her occupied and she was easily able to break chunks off of this ball and tear it apart. We had to take it away and throw it in the garbage so she didn’t eat any little pieces. Might be good if you have a very gentle dog, but it won’t stand up to tug or any rough play with a 75lb GSD.

Thinking that the medium with the next size I ordered it and it’s so large and heavy, It’s bigger than his head and too much for him to carry he doesn’t like it. So it’s disappointing. Not the toys fault, it’s my fault that I wasted the money because he can’t play with it Because it’s too heavy for him to pick up. He’s a king Charles spaniel</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 3 1/2-month-old Catahoula Leopard Dog/Border Collie mix puppy who needs lots of play, especially due to his mix of breeds. Being a puppy, he wants to chew on everything and his mix makes him a strong chewer, even at his age. He also loves to play fetch (well, his version of it) and tug-of-war. I got this in a large as I didn't want to have to constantly rescue it from under the couch or other furniture. I've had this for 1 1/2 months and so far it has stood up wonderfully to his chewing on it and can withstand our vigorous games of tug-of-war (for ""drop-it"" training). It still looks like new. It's great for indoor play since it is flexible: I can toss it across the room, against a wall</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I started by putting our 13lb Cockapoo's favorite Kong plush dog toy inside and she would work to get it out.  Now, she works to ""jailbreak"" her duck, frog, bear, rope, and lamb from their ""prison"".  She absolutely loves it and it keeps her busy for quite a while.  I can understand some dogs tearing it apart, but we haven't had that problem.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">While I have seen less than great reviews, these balls are awesome for my super chewers. Have both the small and large and my dogs love these. The large is a little too big for treats and the small are, well, too small. I have both 100lb and 50lb dogs. Chasing and tugging have held up well. They seem to like the ""chew"" and I could not be happier. Regular plush toys don't last, but these have now for a month or better, and that says something for me.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So I bought 2 of these I have 2 pitbull and a Argentina dogo both are already dead they have only had them 2 days.  Sadly it's my dogo fav. Toy she carries the pieces around.  I wish it was more heavy duty to withstand my power chewers.  They destroy every toy they come in contact with lol . I have 3 stars cause it's her fav. Toy.  But I would hope they can make them more sturdy . They rip easy . Ima be ordering more this time hopefully have more then 2 they will last a little longer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought 2 of these balls after seeing a Pinterest project. The ball was stuffed with ribbons/strips of fabric for the dogs to pull out. It worked great for my dog that pulls tags off of everything. It is a good quality product. It's made of soft pliable rubber so when tossed it doesn't damage anything it may hit. Well worth the money. I am considering buying the smaller sizes as well.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I had this recommended by a family member. Their dogs always have one and love it. They have destroyed a couple by normal wear but they love them. My puppy had wear cracks in the rubber an hour into having the toy and then had a huge hole a little bit later. So I would recommend as a fantastic toy if you don’t have a toy destroyer on your hands like me</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Maltese Poodle mix loved how it bounced but once I put a treat in it she had this ripped open in less than 15 minutes! Unfortunately I cannot recommend this unless your dog isn’t a chewer or smart enough to figure out how to pull with her paws and bite/chew at the same time to get the treats out.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Puppies seem to like big toys and this one is big but lightweight (Ihave the medium size).

By the end of our outside time (definitely not an inside toy) his front is soaked in slobber. But he absolutely loves it. He will ignore any other toy we bring out for him when this comes out! Overall as long as you are ok with a potentially messy pup I would definitely recommend this toy! The only reason I gave it a 4 start</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">After watching my ACD throw and chase her chuck it ball, we decided to find a low cost herding ball. She’s slowly showing more interest. My only concern is that since it is so hard, she may break a tooth as she alternates between nosing, pawing and trying to bite it. But knowing she is interested in it, we’ll probably splurge for a jolly ball at a later time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">There are two versions of this ball. One is nearly twice as heavy as the other. The lighter, better (safer and faster in play) version we bought from Chewy. Dobby is ADDICTED to rolling this ball! We have a great time playing as partners! He will wait by the door of any room in which it's being stored to tell me he wants to play ""small-ball."" And I have to force him to take breaks during play because it's such a fast, vigorous, exhausting game. When I begin to reach for the ball, he literally grabs it from me with his paws, or rolls it away as fast as he can go. But if I ask him to take a rest, he immediately lies down and ""holds"" the ball until he's rested enough to begin play again. He has </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought the 14"" one and it is huge!  Our Rottweiller destroys anything soft or chewy.  We have purchased a few Jolly balls and he destroys them after one day!  He loves this ball - he chases it around and kicks it all around the yard.  I think the fact he can't bite into it is the best part. It is hard and I don't recommend for indoor use - but it is worth it for indestructibility.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a dog daycare. This product just arrived and none of the dogs will play with it. I have one boxer dog that puts her paw on it, but that's it. I was hoping they would nose it around. I will update this if I see dogs take interest. otherwise, try the teaser ball or the ball like this with the rope on each side. the dogs are loving those.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered two for our large breed 4 month old pups.  They appear to need a little time to get acquainted but I am just going to let them lay around for a bit.  Do not think these are bouncy balls, they are quite hard surface but that is good.  Thank you Chewy for sending the two different colors.  Who ever did the packing took the time to place both colors.  Thank you!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our puppies LOVE balls all balls except for these!  Yes, these balls are indestructible but, my dogs haven't even attempted to play with them.  When I first introduced them to our yard our puppies barked at them like they were an intruder.  Once the danger was alleviated they've gone completely ignored.  I try to roll them to our dogs. . . nothing.  I try to engage our dogs with them. . . nothing.  They are large and hard plastic and I can't see why a dog would be interested in them either.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">If you have a herding dog YOU NEED THIS! My blue heeler constantly wants to play fetch and was never interested in playing with any other toys or even my other dogs to entertain himself, which I don’t mind playing fetch 100 times a day most of the time, but a girl is lazy some days! So I had very low hopes for this, but he took to it immediately and is obsessed!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">we have three dogs. one of them being a smart mix breed. This ball not only exercises him, but mentally challenges him. BEST THING EVER. He knows where we keep it and he will stand by the cupboard and stare at it until you take it out. Once he is done playing and we put it away, he is out sleeping. THANK YOU!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I loved seeing how other dogs love this ball so I ordered two- one for each of my dogs. One was really crazy about them on the first day, the other was “okay” with them-but once they realized they couldn’t get a grip on them they abandoned both of the balls. I will donate them to our shelter. They’ll be well used there!</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/virtually-indestructible-ball-dog-toy/dp/134202

The squeaker lasted a little more than half an hour. For this doggie, that's a long time! The good news is that it is easy to find inexpensive replacement squeakers on the internet. For this toy, the ones listed at 15-16mm long are the right size. Weirdly enough, the replacement squeakers often last longer than the original.
After a several of hours of play, the surface of the ball is still intact, which is lovely, compared to most other toys I've gotten for her. The ball has a nice high bounce and she loves chasing it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have several super-chewer dogs. I ordered two large and one medium of these gnawsome squeaker balls. I was positive they’d be destroyed within hours. It’s now been eight days and all the toys are in perfect shape. I’m not saying your dog won’t destroy these, but my Malinois and hound dog, who both notoriously shred every toy they are given, are still happily playing. The plastic is more durable than I expected and they have good bounce. My pups love to squeak these dang things so much I barely get a break, which isn’t awesome while holed up at home... and all my friends now ask if I have a bird when we talk over the phone. But indoor fetch is more exciting than ever and it makes me happy to</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Purchased this item not sure if it would be too small for my great dane, but it was Perfect! The squeak really keeps her entertained and she will even play by herself sometimes . She enjoys it and looks forward to ""playtime"". Durable quality, bought 2 and both are still in tact. First one lost a little ""bounce"" but second one is still going strong.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">As mentioned in other reviews, Spikes do reduce the speed with which Puppy destroys the toy, as she seems to enjoy the feeling of nubs.  Once she got a hole in it, she then made progress in disassembly each time she had it. We use it for her to chase (She’s not a retriever!) and remove it soon after.  If she were allowed to chew at will, it would be destroyed in a short time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Boston Terrier is possessed when it comes to playing with this ball. It is the perfect size for her and with the squeaker in it, she goes crazy when catching it. The rubber spikes all over the exterior of the ball also massage her mouth when catching and chewing on it. I bought two of them and will have to get more as she will go through them as much and often as she plays with them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These balls are my yorkie / terrier mix's favorite!  She recently destroyed her last one and I have looked every-where and bought a dozen others over the last few months.  She refused to play with any of them and just looked at me with such a pitiful look that none of them was her ""squeaky ball"".  Not having the actual manufacturer and only pieces of the old one from which to estimate the size, I took a chance on these.  She was skeptical at first, but once she played with it a little and we played catch a time or two, she realized that indeed ""Squeaky Ball"" is BACK!!  Thank you, Thank you!  You've made my little 12lb Terrorist a very happy girl again!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">my dog likes those squeaker balls and other toys and somehow finds a way to chew the squeaker out and rip them apart so i decided to get a ball a little bigger for his size and it’s still brand new !!!

She lost her first one but our local pet store didn’t have a large Chuck It Ultra so I tried tennis balls but those got destroyed within a day, and other rubber balls just didn’t make her as happy as her Chuck It did! Thankfully Chewy had a really good deal on Large Chuck It balls so I FINALLY got one. My dog was ECSTATIC! She would play and play and play until she is desperate for water! I am not sure if it’s the orange color or the fact that it’s hollow and she can squeeze it but it’s her absolute favorite. Thank you Chuck It and thank you Chewy for making my dog happy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a GSD-Malinois mix who is VERY VERY chewy. HE LOVES the XL Ultra and I love that a month later it hasn't fallen apart! No matter how he bites it, it shows no signs of wear. My only complaint is that it gets VERY slippery with slobber when we are playing ball so I have to keep a bandana onhand! Bounces really well on (hard) grass and other surfaces and the orange color means we find it in the weeds. I've ordered more in case we lose it, not because it was falling apart. Definitely worth the money!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I just got my first pit bull (3yo) about a month ago. She had a regular sized Chuckit! ball when she moved in, but my Boston Terrier kept stealing it so I thought I'd get some bigger ones. I also decided to get some other toys to keep the PB from getting bored.

I shouldn't have bothered.

This dog has chewed through 4 rope toys, and 2 stuffed toys. She's demolished one of those tire toys. I'm afraid to get her a Kong because I might just cry when she rips it to shreds in 4 hours.

The Chuckit! balls, on the other hand, have survived. She lays on the floor and chews them like they were gum, but they just bounce right back! She hasn't managed to destroy a single one of the three!

When</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have 7 golden retrievers.  Chuck it rubber type balls are the only balls they will use.  It’s to bad that the Chuckit throwers don’t come with these higher end balls.  My dogs won’t touch the orange and blue tennis type balls that come with the Chuckit throwers.  They run after the tennis type balls but when they get to them they sniff them and just walk away- I have  to retrieve them.  So, now the tennis material balls go straight to the trash.  Such a waste of resources.  For the price, Chuckit should provide these higher in balls that last longer, are much less apt to be  destroyed and swallowed in pieces and are more sanitary.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Chuckit makes the best fetch balls. My GSD loves squeaky ones, but she likes this one too. They bounce better than tennis balls and are much much more durable. They last a long time. Definitely worth the cost. They’re easy to rinse off and clean up, unlike tennis balls. My dog likes to drop her balls in her water bowl when we take a break and these don’t need to be dried out for days like tennis balls.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this product because all the comments said how strong the toy is and how long it lasted. Unfortunately, my two year old Am Staff was able to destroy it in LESS than a WEEK! If you have a dog with a strong jaw and loves to chew this product might not be ideal if your looking for a toy to last longer than a week   Pretty disappointed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Got this for a friend’s Rottie-Shepherd mix, and it’s still intact after two weeks’ free access. He’s not a typical power-chewer: rather, his favorite hobby is figuring out how to take things apart. He finds a toy’s weak spot with shepherd’s determination, focus, and sheer bliss for creative problem solving; and then applies the full bite strength of his likely breed mix to systematically and joyously dismantle it like a kid with a Christmas box. His house is littered with tiny fragments of top-brand tough toys - hard rubber reduced to confetti, hard plastic puzzle toys confiscated when the plastic began cracking, scraps of reinforced seams, with the alleged puncture-proof kevlar and stuffing</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our Labmaraner has been unable to destroy these, though she finally  has put a small puncture in one of them. I think what has kept them lasting longer than any of the other toys we have bought her is that she doesn't just lay here and gnaw on them like the others. She loves playing fetch with them and tries to get us to play tug of war with them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves these balls and this is a nice size so I don’t have to worry about her accidentally swallowing it. We kick it off the porch and it goes sailing across the yard and she loves to chase after it that way. She has popped  the smaller size so we went to this bigger one and it seems to be holding up fine for now.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’ve got 3 heelers all in different sizes. I got the x-large chuckit ball because the medium ones always roll under the couch and this one doesn’t!

This probably would not be the best ball for a strong or power chewer. Our only disappointment is the squeaker broke within the first few days of her playing with it. It is a very affordable toy and worth the small cost to replace it because our pup loves it so much. She likes all her toys but I honestly think this is her favorite. I would recommend and have recommended this ball. I have given this ball to my mother and brother who both have 30lb Australian Shepherds. Both of the Australian Shepherds love</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Yuba LOVES this darn thing. She actually ""found"" this ball 2x before I figured out what it was and ordered it. First, she found one at a lake and would not let it go - sadly we learned it belonged to another dog. When she ""found"" it again at another lake, she took off to play independently with it and would not let me near her to take it away!  The other hoomans did not seem impressed. I went home that day and ordered 2! I remove it after a certain amount of play because the squeaking does get a little annoying... I would also agree with other reviews that the packaging is not great - poorly designed with tiny plastic pieces pierced through the ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Chinese Crested of 19lbs, absolutely loves these squeaky balls. He has small, medium and large. For some reason he loves the large one best, but plays with them all. Funny thing is that the large one has the highest pitch squeal when you squeeze it, and the other two are more normal. The large one sounds like a large bird and even though he has tiny teeth, it takes him longer to pick up the large one and he doesn’t care if it just takes him a few more seconds then picking up the others and he is happy as can be throwing it into the air, chasing it, or just sleeping with them. One of the best toys, for sure.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I make sure I have these balls with me in the house, car, and my pocket when walking. The three I keep in my car are for when we go to a park.  The small balls fit in the ""ChuckIt"" stick for tennis balls.  The one in my pocket is to get my dogs attention when another dog approaches.  The ball squeaks and he responds every time.  I definitely have to have at least three for inside.  I bought some medium and large ones for my friends large golden retriever.  He hoards them and loves them.  My little dog can also pick up the medium balls.  I highly recommend these gems.  I wouldn't want to be without them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our Australian Cattle Dog was obsessed with one specific ball that kept being chewed further down by a family dog until it became a shallow bowl- we couldn't find a replacement that he loved as much and he would just want us to throw this sad little sliver what once was a ball... until now!!! 

HE LOVES THIS BALL.... SO MUCH. We immediately bought extra so we'll have back ups. 

He's not an aggressive chewer so they're holding up super well. We just have to keep them out of reach of that one family dog with little dagger teeth (haha) that can destroy them in a matter of minutes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have 110 lb. Bernese Mtn Dog, and this is by far his favorite toy!   It's a big substitute also for chewing on things you don't want chewed.   We play with it in the house and outside.  It has a nice bounce so when I can get it away from him we play fetch and he can catch it on the bounce!   I order one a month because after a few weeks of chewing , water and slobber it deflates a bit and  little foam pieces come out.  I've tried other firmer squeaky balls the same size but none catches his attention over this one!    And so easy with Chewy to come with his auto ship.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Goldie (Akita mix) has plenty of balls but the Hartz Dura Play balls in all sizes are her absolute favorite! It may be because they are bacon scented. They are tough and she loves their squeak and the way they bounce. After dinner, we have to ""play ball""  and she never gets tired of them. She was a rescued mother dog and it is heart warming to see her have so much fun playing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">One of my dogs is very mellow and shy.  But once you take this ball out she goes NUTS! It is the only toy we can get her to go crazy about and she will play fetch with it all day.  It is strictly and outside toy in our household because she squeaks it so much!  I highly recommend this toy to anyone!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Not sure why this ball is so better than all others. But my ball obsessed doodle loves it. It is a mess to clean up if he gets to the foam so the second I see a hole it goes in the trash and I order 5 more. When I’m tired I have to hide it. The other reviews are right the squeaker is loud and annoying but it only lasts a few days.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We got our 7-week old lab puppy last week and she absolutely adored this ball!

Yesterday after 2 years of daily play he bit it a little to hard and then started to dismantle it. I found the ball on Chewy but could not pick the color. I called and they found him a green ball. We should have it tomorrow. 

Well we didn’t get a green ball we revived a red one. I called and they said they couldn’t insure a green one but would try again. We received a blue ball. Cooper has settled on the blue for now. The green one is now in two pieces and still being played with. Chewy really tried for us.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Why does my baby loves this ball rather than the many others I previously got him...size?...the blinking?...no smooth surface makes it easier to catch?...NO IDEA...but he goes everywhere with it...and shares it with his sister while playing ....i order a few more...very durable..been one week and ball still intact!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Like, VERY loud.  Wednesday is deaf, so that part doesn't do her any good.  However, it lights up!  She is also vision-impaired and has difficulty seeing certain colors, especially when there is a lot of furniture/stuff in the room or her other toys are scattered about. The flashing lights grab her attention every time, and the ball usually stays lit long enough for her to get to it.  Just beware, the squeaker is super loud.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog 1. Loves balls and 2. Loves to play with things that light up outside in the dark. She’s pretty rough so I figured even if this lasts a week it’ll be fine . The ball flashed once as I took it out of the box and never again. Total rip off. Very disappointed. It also took her maybe 10 minutes to rip it open.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered 4 of these light up balls,they also squeak. 
Two light up , two didn't. Chewy replaced the ones and one of those don't work. I really,really wish Chewy could check things like this it is so frustrating to have to have them replaced even though Chewy replaced them immediately.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our husky/malamute LOVES this ball, the light up feature keeps him chasing it and rolling around with it constantly, the squeak is very loud and he make sure you know it! Very durable for aggressive chewers, I never worry that he can chew this up, I do always supervise when he plays with the toy. Highly recomend!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Let me start by saying I’ve bought similar toys from Chewy in the past and been pleased.  This particular toy, however, did not light up very well and the light mechanism only lasted for about two weeks.  Such a disappointment for me and my dog who really enjoys the light-up toys.  Now it is just another squeaky ball.  When I buy again, I will look for a different brand.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The lights last a decent amount of time. It’s neat to watch the ball bounce through the yard at night.
While this toy can be quickly chewed up, our pit bull treats it as his security blanket. He plays fetch as much as possible with this ball, cleans it, and sleeps with it.</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/gnawsome-squeak-light-led-ball-dog/dp/166238

This is wonderful! It doesn't take long (just a few minutes) to get to glowing and it lasts a long time. The longer you ""charge"" it in the light, the longer the glow time. My dog has no problem finding the ball and tracking it when I throw it now. I only keep it as an outside toy and take it away from her when we're done, but even though she has chewed on it some, it still is in great shape, like new. It also rinses off very easily after all the dog slobber and dirt. I will definitely buy it again if she ever ruins this one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a ball obsessed Labrador retriever who requires daily exercise. These glow in the dark balls are just the ticket! They are not quite as thick and heavy as the original Chuckit! balls but these feature a slight whistle when flying through the air and they seem to be just as indestructible. The best part is that when he is running back to me in the dark, after the retrieve all I can see is a floating ball coming at me! With the shorter days coming in the winter months, we will be able to continue our daily play time!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Remember the days of “must see tv”? That’s what this glow ball is for our standard golden doodle. Every night after supper she asks to go outside with it no matter what. During daytime she loves treats inside for good chewing in her crate. I’d say it’s a top 5 toy for her, maybe even top 3. She’s a power chewer and these have lasted more than 6 months.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I love that I can find them in the dark or throw them in the dark. My dog loves the texture the sound they make. She is a very aggressive chewer. They give when she chews and usually last at least a month or more making them economical for me too. She is a Corgi Beagle mix and has a high prey drive. She likes the regular orange and blue Chuckit balls too and Kong toys. The Chuckit last the longest with her.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog can’t get enough! He absolutely loves these balls. He even falls asleep with them. He loves how the ball makes a whistle sound when it’s thrown and I love that they glow in the dark so I can find it! The best part is that he can’t destroy the ball and trust me he has tried.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have been purchasing these for my Doberman for years now. They are so durable. He chews on them all day and they don't break. They are great for playing fetch because he can hear the whistle. Hands down. The best ball for dogs!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This works very well in the dark I got the large since I have German shepherds. They look so funny when they run back all you can see is the glow ball. They are softer than the regular balls so once we done playing I don't let them chew on them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I tend to play with my dog a lot at night down here in Texas. It’s just too hot to be outside in daylight. Didn’t have very high expectations for this ball but WOW! It is amazing! Stays lit the entire time I’m outside - upwards of an hour. I put it up right next to a light before going out and that makes it extra bright. Very easy for my dog to see the light and for me to find it if it’s too dark outside. Highly recommend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We lost the ball that came with the launcher and we are happy to have a new one to replace it. It's a good quality ball and the holes make it go farther when thrown or especially launched.The glow in the dark feature is great!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My high energy Mal just loves these balls! It is the only thing she does not destroy! I love the fact that at night when she pushes them under the couch they glow! LOL!

As soon as he had access to the tennis ball that started to get torn apart too. Would not recommend for tougher chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was a bit miffed when it took my 14 month old boxer boy less than 5 minutes to get the smaller ball out. I have since changed my mind and I’ve decided this is one of my favorite toys. Even without the interior ball he won’t stop playing with it because it’s got an addictive squeak that he can’t get enough of. He takes quick breaks to go potty and hang out with his big sis a bit then goes right back to playing with it.

In a matter of half an hour, our boy had the tennis ball out, and chewed most of the outer layer off.  Threw out the ball, and let him play with the plastic part. Within a half an hour, he chewed a hole in the edge of that. So, after an hour of play, the toy went in the trash.

I also ordered it because it was Kong brand, and I thought it would be good due to the brand (never had issues before). They did not have this toy for more than 30 mins before they were able to bite huge chunks off of the toy. Very disappointed, I thought it would hold up and last longer than 30 mins. Would not recommended.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">FedEx delivered this 2 hours ago, and it is already torn apart. Not durable at all. But have to say the doggie loves it. Do not buy if you have a tough chewer. It won’t last.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have an APBT. She can destroy any toy. As suspected, the tennis ball inside this toy was pulled out and shredded within hours; however, the squeaking of the remaining part of the toy kept her entertained for weeks!

Well needless to say, we were excited knowing she likes tennis ball and thouht this would hold up better then a real one only to see that the ball didn't even last 24 hours of playing inside our apartment! The ball has split in half and now she is pulling the fuzz off. The core is nothing like a tennis ball and it does not bounce. I wish I would have read the reviews first so if you are reading this don't bother with the balls. I'm hesitant to give her the second ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our golden retriever loves tennis balls and we stopped by getting him a brand made specifically for dogs that they would be even better quality, he unfortunately tore into these within seconds of receiving them. He has never torn open up a tennis ball before. We thought it was a fluke but he destroyed all 4 balls from this manufacturer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">They are a great product for the average dog. But our Border Collie, Kelpie, Smithfield, immigrant from Australia, has to chew the ball in-between throws. It lasted 5 minutes before he punctured the first ball. I hesitated to offer the second too soon. It too, was split in two within the next couple of days. On a positive note, the Whistler Chuck-it balls work a treat. No punctures and he's adapted well to the different texture.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">my golden retriever loves chuck it tennis balls she’s kind of old and doesn’t like to exercise but these got her in the mood to play!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I am a daschund terrier mix about 19 lbs. this is bigger than a standard tennis ball. Although it was fun, I ate part of the fuzz cover and the ball was a bit too big for even my big mouth</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pit bull destroyed this ball in less than three minutes. Her teeth went right through it. I would not recommend for heavy chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I personally don't have a chuck it thrower so I can't rate them on that aspect. But, they were cheaper than tennis balls so I got them. Overall really impressed especially with the size (large) they were just the right size not to big not to small for a 10 month old vizsla. They have survived my little tennis ball monster and thats a high compliment!! Highly recommend!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Seems these are glued together in the middle, after my dog compressed them a bit they came apart right away</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These balls did not stand up well. My dog doesn’t have the opportunity to just chew on them. We play fetch: I toss it and he brings it back. We play with 2 at a time - I throw one he brings it back and I throw the other. Both of them have split. They also don’t bounce. Tennis balls work much better. I wouldn’t get these again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These are terrible. My dog chewed off the fuzz the first time playing with it. Now her poop is full of orange fuzz.

Looking closer it says dimensions 3x3x3.... which is probably the same size as a tennis ball which is how it arrived.  This size is not large. Beware! This size can get caught in the back of a GS mouth and occlude their airway.

Balls are always a hit, but the cut-out design adds more interest for her. And she loves the scrunchy sound the inside ball makes! At first she was a little afraid of this toy and barked and barked, but it's now a favorite. It rolls and there's the additional advantage that it's really tough and handles well with a determined chewer.  The only drawback is it's heavy and if it's through it clunks down hard and I worry it might accidently hit her, so it's a roll only toy at our house. But this is definately a keeper. We plan to get one in another size soon and maybe even order one for her best friend across the street who is also a chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I thought the concept would be a good change up from the normal ball but Zoey isn’t a fan lol the ball is very well designed and will hold up, it is kinda a harder ball to get to make noise but a larger dog would have no issues!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this for Stan, but right out of the box it was a hit with Joy and Harmony too.  So now all 3 dogs play with it, stopping only to eat and sleep.

Once she figured out how to approach the ball, she fell in love. It's very loud, so not a great ball for playing fetch indoors, but a nice change of pace from the balls that my dog tends to destroy in no time flat! It seems to be holding up well!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a small min pin/chiuahua and she loves this ball. It's easy for her to carry around but I also take it away when she's done playing because the rubber is soft enough for her to chew up if I leave her unoccupied.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Received our new dog toy.

# love KONG</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My JRT (rip Roxy) absolutely loved this ball, which is just as big as she was! She eventually ate the squeaker out, but it frustrated her to no end that she couldn't get the tennis ball out of the middle, LOL!  My GSD, Luna, grabs this ball by a handle and shakes it, making the ball rattle violently inside!  Then she grabs the large rubbery ball's exterior and loves to bite it because it squeaks!  We tell Luna ""Shake it?"" and she does; ""Squeak it!"" and she does. This is a toy that every dog will love -- plus you can play old-school FETCH with it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 105-lb Rottie enjoyed 10 minutes of supervised fun with this toy! We were laughing so hard that our stomachs hurt (her reactions to the sounds, watching her sling the juggler around to get the smaller ball loose, etc.). We walked out of the room for less than TWO MINUTES and returned to scattered pieces!! I had high hopes for this KONG toy, but all toys are not created equal - even if it's a brand you previously trusted as strong enough. Fun while it lasted...all ten minutes worth.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pittie LOVES this ball. He is a super chewer and often destroys toys within minutes. This particular ball has a tennis ball inside and he is SO motivated to try and chew through the ball to get the tennis ball inside. It takes him forever - his last jumbler ball lasted about 6 months. He does eventually chew off the handles, then tries to puncture the middle part. But considering most toys don't last longer than a week, this is perfect for him.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a doggie daycare/boarding business and this ball is a big favorite among all dogs sizes. The handle makes it easy for smaller dogs to carry or they offer a smaller size.  I find that the larger one suits most dogs because it's not heavy. It squeaks too!  This is my 7th one.  The down side is huge mouthed dogs crush it and they sometimes split at the seem.  Still very usable for a while though.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I've gotten this ball a few years ago and it was bigger. This one is still a good size. My boxer's and hound love these balls. They throw them and shake them. I'm giving 4 stars because my one boxer was able to chew through the handle trying to get to the small tennis ball inside. The ball inside is very small. Just make sure you watch them if they start to play with it. My dogs love this toy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy was recommended to me. It became my dogs favorite toy. The squeaker lasted 3 weeks. Pretty good when it’s the only toy being played with. My dog enjoyed biting the squeaker spot and that’s how the squeaker broke. Lol. Although it’s no longer his favorite, we still enjoy playing with it! I love the handles it makes it easier to play tug. I would recommend since I plan on buy another. 
I have a medium dog (43 lb).</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The handle is nice so your dog can pick it up from either side and the rumble the ball makes when it rolls keeps them interested! I’ve had it for a few months now and my dog hasn’t make a dent in it yet and she has some power (Great Dane pup). It’s a great ball that doesn’t roll under your couch too saving your from having to move your furniture to revive it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a really fun toy and for the average dog it would likely last quite a while, unfortunately my dog has realized the best way to take of the two handles.

Definitely will get more.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I don't even know how this toy works. Its latex, my dog is a super chewer.

If he ever destroys or loses these, we will buy them again</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have bought about 8 of these at different times. Two were stolen by the neighbor dogs so I got them some for Christmas.  In addition Ive bought several for my GSD and she loves them.  They seem to hold up very well.  She has one that the squeaker came out of but she still loves it</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I already had a green one of these and my dog loves it so much that I bought another. It is pink but the color makes it easy to find in the grass. When I say grab a toy this is the one he grabs. He will carry it around waiting for someone to play. I squeeze it and he comes running to see why I have ""his"" toy! The play begins. He usually eats every toy but he has not eaten either one of these. I am not great at ordering online but Chewy makes it easy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have the orange ball of this brand and my labradoodle loves it.  LOVES it.  I was so excited to see another version so I bought the bone.  He ran upstairs with it.  By the time I followed along a few minutes later I found nothing but stuffing all over the floor.  He did enjoy the toy for those few minutes but I had hoped it would last much much longer.  I couldn't be more disappointed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">After all chew toys I have purchased for my two Pomsky/Huskies. Latex always seems to be the best option. They haven not even put a dent in this toy. However, it seems they are always able to remove squeaker inside or push it into toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 12.5-lb mini Cockapoochon LOVES thus bone! Her favorite WAS the Hartz Dura Play Small Ball, but this tops it! It's the perfect size for her to carry around. I will buy more in hopes to get 1 of each color, since it's a random color pick. Warning, it does have a pretty loud squeaker in it, but at least I know where she is &amp; what she's doing. She's still young, so she gets into trouble easily &amp; quickly!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a small one and apparently a medium one this was way bigger than I expected but my dog loves it for ""fetch"".  The Medium sized one he tore up but the small on and larger one have survived.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pup just loves this bone. She tries to eat all toys, but not the Dura Play toys. Baby bones, balls, big bones, all bounce and float! We are happy that the Large bone is available again and purchased an extra for a friend’s pup! Highly recommend!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dogs simply love this toy and we have bought them multiple times. It is suggested for small dogs. Our dogs are medium to large (55 and 80 lbs) but they love to throw them in the air, tug on them, and chew them. Eventually, they rip them open and take out the stuffing and we need to re-buy them. But they get so much pleasure from them, that we don't mind the multiple purchases.</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/hartz-dura-play-bone-squeaky-latex/dp/110535

Because of the outer rubber shell, the tennis ball lasts much longer. The squeak, which my gsd loves, doesn’t last as long as it should but it hangs on la manger than the squeaking tennis balls.

My smaller dogs just carry it in their mouths—it’s too hard for them to chew on it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It's easier to grab a hold and toss.

One for my dog and one for my brothers dog.  Opened my dogs ball.  He loved it.  Stopped working after 2 days.  I thought the battery died. Good thing I Still had my brother’s dog ball.  Opened it and switched batteries.  Nope, didn’t work.  I put the batteries back on my brother’s ball.  It worked.  The battery was not the problem on my ball.  Even though my ball stopped working, I still gave it 5 stars.  Plus, it is easy for my dog to pick up with his mouth!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the best $6 toy I have ever bought.  Remington can chew up the toughest of toys in 5 minutes or less.  He's tough on all types of toys.  But this talking toy has lasted over a week + off hard playing.  He runs all over the house, throws it, barks at it (thus I only give it to him for short spurts of exercise), and plays keep-away with my son with it.  I can't believe how tough it is and how he's still crazy about it after a week.  Just a few nicks in the hard plastic, I'm sure some day I'll want it to die due to the noise it causes in the house but for now, it's funny to watch him go crazy and entertain himself.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have an American Bulldog and she had 0 interest in this ball and even though the talking did not interest her she wasn't actually interested in it all as a ball. I don't know if the slick texture or talking made her not like it but she won't play with this at all, I bought her the hard blue and green Kong ball after this one didn't work and she absolutely love that one. Even though it is a working product, it Just didn't work for us.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball talks in the high pitched voice that dogs seem to like. Some people said their dogs were frightened of it. That was not at all my experience. My (14 week old) puppy loves to push it around and he seems to think he can induce it to play with him because he keeps making play bows. It's wonderful fun to watch.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my 7-month-old Beagle's favorite toy.  He will chase it all over the house, especially under beds and furniture and then bark at it until I retrieve it.  It's a fun game for him.  When he is pestering his sister (11-year-old Lab), I can roll it down the hall and redirect him.  It is the ball that I can hide at the bottom of his toy basket and he will dig through everything to find it.  I'm probably order a spare, just in case, but after three weeks of very rough play, it still babbles it's way through our house.

Shes a sucker for any toy that rolls so this toy really entertains her. It really does tease her because she wants to get to the ball inside but it rolls away from her so she has to chase it and try again. The product is plastic so I can definitely see that if not monitored she could probably chew right through it. Although I’m not too worried right now since she gets tired from it rolling away from her and takes a break. Score! (Sometimes I can’t play so this toy is awesome) I got a size small and she is about 45lbs, perfect size for her to hold. Shipping was fast as well, thanks chewy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is obsessed with this ball. He loves to play soccer around the yard with this yipping and barking as he tries to get the inside ball. Once he tires out he will lay down and try to pull the small ball out. This toy was originally bought for another dog who didn’t have interest in it, but mine absolutely loves it. He has had this toy for over a year and a half - and spent a lot of time trying to get it apart and has just succeeded! He plays with both pieces still. He is a super chewer but surprisingly it took time to chew through this toy. This was well worth the money and will be buying again. Great to play with your dog with and to occupy your dog in its own.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our girl, Nagi Bear has zero interest in this ball. Which is a real bummer because it was suggested to me for our super chewer. Unfortunately, when we opened it and gave it to her she just pushed it around for a few seconds with her nose and walked away. The next morning I took it outside to the yard to see if kicking it around would entice her but still no interest. She found more joy sniffing the grass blades individually, lol. This is probably a great toy for some, Nagi Bear just didn't get it. I gave it two stars for durability and speed of shipment.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a Belgian Malinois so to say he needs tough toys that keep him entertained is an understatement. We love this ball because it actually keeps him very entertained, he will run around with it all day. 
I would say the only problem for me is the weight, my dog slams it into the fence and it’s broken a couple fence boards in half. 
I definitely will buy it again, I’ll probably just not leave it in the yard for him unsupervised.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This states on the box it is not a chew toy. It is not. My large 6 month old German Shepherd puppy enjoyed this for a short time but when he realized the inside ball would not come out he got bored with it and would start to chew it or pick it up and carry it along and drop it and ignore it. It’s hard plastic so you do have to watch your dog with it that he doesn’t chew the plastic into sharp edges.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My two-year-old lab has destroyed many toys in just minutes. She’s had this magical blue ball for about four months, and is still completely enraptured. Just infatuated by it. It’s sturdy enough to handle her teeth and interesting enough to keep her focus for HOURS on end. Chesler is extremely social and usually jumps on people when they come in the house. But when people come over to hang out in the yard, I give her this magical blue ball and she couldn’t care less about the visitors. It’s a great party trick, because no one has ever seen a dog so transfixed. It is my only rival for the position of her best friend, and I’m totally okay with that.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball would be great for dogs who don’t grip down super tight on it. We have two German Shepherds and they like the ball but in just a few days, put groves in the hard plastic leaving sharp edges all over it. We are concerned they might get cut on the edges. On a positive side it is a fun ball for our shepherd who holds another toy in his mouth and plays with the ball as if he were playing soccer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a very busy Corgi puppy. She enjoys playing with this altho she isn’t super fascinated by it. It is sturdy and will hold up to her hard chewing. She can make a bit of racket throwing it about as the outer ball is hard plastic. If you live in an apartment and your dog really goes nuts playing with it this could be something to be aware of. It helps keep her occupied tho.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">He really enjoys playing with this in the yard. He is a super chewer and this does the trick to occupy him, but I'm worried that the bite marks on the plastic are going to cut his mouth. Kind of wish the plastic was thicker (like kong material).</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Yes it already has bite marks where he chomped down on it but he’s a chewer!  He initially just kept carrying it around the yard. However, round two he started to nudge it and pass at it to roll it and when he got tired he started chomping on it. That’s what we do though!  The holes are big enough for him to stick his entire bottom jaw in. He even played fetch with it a few times too. It was self entertaining for short periods of time which is excellent!</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/jolly-pets-teaser-ball-dog-toy-blue-8/dp/38800

Does anyone have recommendations for good treats to stuff in this one?</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 11 week old puppy gets the treats out in less then 5 minutes. The slots are too shallow and the treats come out very easily. You have to have a tiny, tiny treat as I do but they still are too easy to get out. Going to look for something a little more complicated to keep him busy. The ball itself is study though and stands up to chewing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The dog really likes this because the kibble falls out way to easily.  One side has a smaller opening and the other a larger opening.  I'm going to try string cheese sticks to see if this keeps her busy longer.  However, if you're feeding a kibble meal using this ball, it would work well.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Not what I expected but Zoey loves it! The Kong treats are easy to insert into the ballot toy. For whatever reason, Zoey does not chew on this ball when it is empty. If only Zoey would bring the ball back to me when she is done! Would buy this ball again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Every dog is different. My black lab plays with this toy a lot. She has learned to nudge the ball with her nose to dislodge treats and when we bounce it for her, she scans the impact radius for her “reward”.  She is not a strong chewer so I know this will last a long time, assuming it doesn’t roll into a dark, hidden place!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have other Kong toys for our aggressive chewing Lab and they’ve held up very well.  He’s been able to chew some chunks off the end of this one though.  Not sure it’s as good as the others.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have been giving him some bully sticks and beef tendons, which he proceeded to swallow about a 4"" bully stick piece whole, one time choking on a beef tendon &amp; we had to reach down his throat to pull it out. I had one of these Kong Ball Toys, in which I shoved through the tiny hole on one end, and it protrudes out the larger end, making it more difficult to swallow the chews. This toy, along with other Kongs, such as the Puppy and Original, have literally been lifesavers for my puppy. Now for the way this toy is meant to be used, he loves the Kong spread, or peanut butter placed in the cracks. I haven't added any small treats in the center hole yet though, but I'm sure he'll love that too.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My rescue hound is scared of squeak toys and I can tell she's bored. The only toy she has shown any interest in is a rope toy but it doesn't hold her attention. I got this and stuffed chicken jerky treats into the slits. She loves it and it entertains her for a while. She actually plays with it</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I literally just took it out of the box and gave it to my dog. He enjoyed it, but ripped the bottom off in literal minutes. Do not recommend, if you have a power chewer like mine.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I’m used to Kong items really holding up to my strong chewer.

She chews on the ball and carries it around by both the ball itself or the rope.  She loves to play tug with it and play fetch with it as well.  The ball is now more pliable than it was when it arrived due to her chewing on it. It's stays outside at all times and is holding up really well.  No actual holes through the ball and even if there were it still would function as it. It's been a great addition to the outside toy options.</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/jolly-pets-romp-n-roll-dog-toy-red-8/dp/38785

I purchased two balls and expect them to last my 50-lb. terrier mix mutts years of fun- a lifetime compared to other dog toys out there and on par with the best quality products Kong offers.

BE ADVISED, these balls are NOT hollow. They are dense and heavy and the medium size would serve a pretty hard blow even to my 50lb. adults if they go for a head-on catch. We've been using them more as chase and catch as they bounce.

I'll be honest, my two guys have never paraded a toy in the way they do this ball. They are VERY pleased and love to show it off. It will be a handy tool.

The toy comes fully equipped with crackly material and squeaker built into the balloon part of the toy.
The rope attached is sturdy but pliable.

The glow in the dark ball is great. Really easy to see at night. 
The whistle ball needs to be louder. It works but not as much as it should.

They stand up to the constant chewing of my seven year old Doberman. The good part  is she loves to play with them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Funny enough, we don't have a Chuckit! and I bought these simply because of the material they are made out of and the fact that my lab mix loves balls. She is a MAJOR chewer and can chew off bits of the BLACK KONG, it's actually amazing to see. She has yet to get a piece out of the orange whistle ball or the blue rubber recycled ball. Incredible! I have not played with the glow ball yet because she has had so much fun with the other two. They bounce great and are highly visible as well. They don't have a rubber smell to them and I love that they are recycled too. Great purchase!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My mini dachshund LOVES the glow balls. Her second favorite are the breathe easy ones(not in this pack). This pack let her try two other chuck it balls. She likes them all but still knows which is the glow ball and she takes it everywhere with her. It glows so bright at night for playing fetch. Well worth the money she can chew up tennis balls and other ball brands but so far Chuck it balls dont RIP or crack.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pit pup LOVES these! I love them because they last! Lost 2 in my other pack and decided to replace it. Lasted over 3 months compared to a tennis ball's 6 throws.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">All of the dogs I’ve ever had are aggressive chewers and would rip a tennis ball in less than 10 minutes.  And I would still buy them anyway just for the times we can actually get more playtime before they’re gone. I bought these and cannot believe that all three are still instant and they have access to them! I would definitely buy again and recommend to those whose dog chews up regular tennis balls. I’m so happy to finally be able to not waste my money on the regular ones.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dogs love chasing these balls. Put them in the chucker handle and throw them. We use two balls because when they bring the one back it teaches them to drop the ball and then we throw the other one.

Then again, she loves all ball toys. I bought a ton of these of different sizes. She is about 42lb lab/whippet.

The toy that works for us is the “Tuff Stick”.  He can get it untied, and he bites it into pieces, but it doesn’t come apart in long strings...it gets chewed into various rope lengths.  He does consume some of it...he IS a power chewer...but, if we don’t catch it right away, so far it passes without problem in his stool.

I saw this knotted ball and thought it would be perfect for Carly.   Carly is an aggressive chewer and this ball did not last 15 minutes without her having it torn apart.

Kong is normally indestructible.  Unfortunately this water toy did not hold up. We only used this toy for the pool. It was a ""fetch and retrieve"" toy.    The toy has a smaller ball on top, connected to a larger ball. If the dog grabs the toy where they meet, it wears down the fabric, and the small ball comes off.

This wasn't a chew toy, but the simple act of grabbing the toy and bringing it back for another go wore down the toy.

My mistake was in giving it to him before boating season, because though it is still together, the ball was torn apart within the toy.

These toys provide multiple ways to carry them so our dogs can figure out how best to swim while holding on to them.  Great pool toys.

I don’t think it’ll last forever but it’s lasted longer than any other ball or toy we’ve gotten</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My giant rottie, Bo, absolutely LOVES this ball. Like seriously, seriously LOVES it. I tried to give him a treat to get the ball away from him, and he chose the ball over a treat - unheard of! My one warning is that the squeaker is VERY loud. On the other hand, I think the squeaker is precisely why he loves it so much. Another thing to note, is that this ball will be destroyed - this is not our first one. But for $4 and the joy it brings him while it is intact and even after it is destroyed (yes, he carried around and played with pieces of it after destroying his first one) it's well worth it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have been trying new brands and toys to see how they hold up to my toy destroyer puppy. This one has a squeaker that lasts a bit longer than the others because air just blows through it to squeak. It met it’s end when the sqeuaker was pulled out. The material is really sturdy though. We still play fetch with it (supervised of course) with the hole in it. The hole has been there for a LONG time and he has only gotten off that small piece of material while chewing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog just loves these balls. he loves to fetch them, jump in the air to catch them, and squeak them till his mama is about to go crazy. I rarely take them away when that happens as he gets so much joy out of them. He's not real good at bringing them all the way back when playing fetch, so we've ordered about 20 of them, half large and half medium and now we all have fun!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">She has a small mouth so I got her the small. And she doesn't have that strong of a jaw. And she literally already has torn a part of the area around the squeaker. Atleast this was cheap. But wth lol. That's pretty ridiculous? This had alot of good reviews..</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I wouldn't recommend this if your dog likes to chew, only if you are playing fetch supervised. My puppy loved this, however it didn't even last a month before he got the squeaker out, essentially leaving a hole for him to chew up the ball also. There are tougher squeaky balls out there.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is one of the few toys that my 45 lb Blue Lacy has not tore up. The ball is made of a sturdy rubber not too hard or too soft. It has a squeaker that she nor our Jack Russell has been able to remove. It has a good bounce to it so we use it a lot for indoor play. They love it and that is all that matters. Thanks Chewy !</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog (a 90lb Malinois Mix) found one of these balls at the park and fell in love with it. She's a heavy chewer and likes to chew balls like bubblegum. So when the freebie ball started to develop large rips near the hole, I thought I'd buy her a new one. I assumed the ball she found was the size Large, so I ordered that. I was super surprised when it arrived and was much larger than I expected. I'd catagorize the Large size as Extra Large. She can still fit it in her mouth, but she prefers when balls are smaller and still favors the old one. Overall, I'd recommend this item, but consider the sizing when purchasing. This ball is good quality for the price.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Good for super chewers, there is nothing for the dog to get ahold of to rip off and its too big for him to get it into the back molars to do damage.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I might actually get her to play fetch because of this ball! She usually goes for soft, plush squeaky toys, so finding a ball she likes is impossible. Until now. She chases it, and takes it to her bed to chew on. She's not a power chewer, so I can't say how durable it is, but she sure loves it! This is Mayzie, our Australian Kelpie with her new favorite toy.</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/jw-pet-isqueak-ball-dog-toy-color/dp/55952

He loves the football shape since he can pick it up and actually use his jaws to squeeze and squeak it himself and it pops back into shape after 1 squeeze.

I’m not sure of any way to fix or glue it back together safely so I’ll need to spend another $10 to buy a new one. The positive about the ball is instead of a loud squeak it’s a softer crackle making it easier on the ears.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this for my ball obsessed german shepard.  Within the first 30 minutes of him playing with it, it has already broken.  Granted it does not specify that it is for a chewer but the adhesive holding the two halves together just came right off.  Not impressed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We received a perfectly satisfactory emerald green ""crackle ball"". I thought my dog would love it, as she adores her toys that used to squeak &amp; now just make air whooshing noises. This toy makes no air whooshing noise. Major bummer. She is so not interested.

She has taken to playing with herself she's realized if she drops it off the end of the couch or the top of the 2 step drop off it bounces and she can play catch with herself (funny because she won't play catch with me) she runs after it usually hitting it with her paws trying to get it sending it rolling/bouncing further and it's just fun to watch overall. She plays with it and will chew at it a bit but I guess she doesn't like chewing it as much because she leaves it be and doesn't try to rip it open like normal tennis</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">While this ball was ideal because it did not squeek, it turns out our lab mix puppy is an extreme chewer, and she bit pieces off within 30 minutes. If your dog is not a toy destroyer, this would be a nice ball</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a 90 pound shepherd boxer hound mix. I ordered this ball large. It’s much smaller than I thought it would be. But he loves it anyway.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This product is made in two halves and those two halves are terribly fused together.  This was destroyed by half in minutes.  I glued it back and returned it to pup and it lasted another five.  It broke in half like it was assembled and shows in the photo.  It isn’t at all like all of the other Kong products I have and I just wanted a ball to throw to my big dog.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We had purchased the Kong Crackle Stick for our 70 lb 1 year old English Bull Terrier months ago and he loved it, but he was able to chew through it and destroy it.

My dog is a medium/small Boston Terrier so no issues as others reported with jaw getting stuck. Watch your pets and shouldn’t have any issues. Only  reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because it does let a few to many treats out with small treats (just find something larger as I did and it correct that problem) and it is a simple pattern and the pups figured it out really quick. Outside of that seems to be great.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Very disappointed in this food dispensing toy.  My nine week old puppy found this toy to be far too easy and could empty it in just a few minutes.  Defeated the purpose of keeping my puppy occupied!

I put their regular food in it now.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loved it and it was fun for her. Sometimes the dog food came out too fast and not very durable.  My friends 2 year old picked it up and dropped it and it snapped. I was super bummed</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was very disappointed with this item.  Maybe it was my dog but it was destroyed within an hour.  I have ordered similar products in the past and was very pleased.  Not so much with this one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this to entertain my girl on her ""hyper"" days. She is a 85 lb bloodhound mix. She loves this ball because she gets to push it around and it drops treats. I have not had the problems that others have posted about. Some treats fall out but not a giant amount at once. The only problem I have seen is that sometimes my dog will want to pick it up and her bottom jaw has gotten stuck in it. So warning, if u have a bigger dog watch them with this incase they get their jaw stuck in it too. Other than that have had no problem with it. Her eyes lite up every time I pull it out lol</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 8 year old and 3 month old dog love it.  They were fighting over who was playing with it!  This is great for the puppy to keep her mind busy and learn new things.   I am going to have to buy another one plus a lot of treats to put inside it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I am so disappointed with this toy. My 2 great dane pups loved this toy. However, it broke within a week of getting it. I am not even sure how it broke. The blue tube inside that the treat can come out of broke off. The dogs could not even get to it so not sure how it manged to break. But once it was broken it does not even work as a ball to chase because the blue part is what holds it together. I would love to try another one but not willing to spend any more money on something that lasted a week.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My staffy mix is very smart and loves puzzle toys, but tends to destroy them quickly. This treat ball has held up surprisingly well. It’s covered in teeth marks but still intact after a week. It’s nice to find a toy for him that will last longer than a single use. My only complaint is that the holes the treats come out of may be a little big for most training treats. I’ve found that for me the treats that work best are Merrick Power Bites and Bones &amp; Chews Freeze-dried treats which are both a little bigger than most training treats.</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/jw-pet-rockin-treat-ball/dp/40247

We purchased a size “large” for our Standard Poodles and this toy has been a big hit.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">If you can get your dog to hold this toy the right way... it’s absolutely hilarious &amp; will bring laughter to many! It’s surprisingly durable but tiny, so I recommend supervision during playtime.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The small is about the size of a plum.  I have a Boston Terrier and ordered the small based on the review of someone with the same breed.  I am going to donate it and order a medium.  My girl is only 18 pounds but she would be able to fit the entire ball in her mouth which seems risky.  I'm not going to take it out of the package to find out, but I know the medium will be much safer for her.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got a small one for my Boston/spaniel pupper. Loves to retrieve and play fetch. So far she has been unable to damage it. Would buy it again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Was so excited to give these as a gift to my daughters dogs. Both were destroyed in less than 5 minutes. I got the medium size and paid way more for them than the small or large. Don’t waste your money. I didn’t even get one picture:(</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I recently ordered this for my 6 month Blue Heeler / boarder collie. I thought the small would be ok. I defiantly should have gotten a bigger one since the small was waaaay too small. Within 5 mins of just having it, it was already destroyed. He loved it for the time being. The rubber is pretty thin so if your dog is very delicate with toys, I would recommend it would be ok for them.</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/rogz-grinz-treat-ball-dog-toy-color/dp/116749

I have 1 x-large Breathe Right Fetch Ball, 6 footballs, 5 ultra balls, 5 ultraRings w/RingChaser &amp; 2 different size Breathe Right Fetch Sticks. I am purchasing more of these balls for sure! My daughter &amp; I play catch with the football. Legend runs back &amp; forth to try to get it from us.  We get carried away with playing catch, that is why I bought 6 footballs so she can join in. lol  They are for all of us to play with now!  Definitely wouldn't recommend leaving your dog unattended with this toy, if they are a chewer.  My Rotty only chews stuffed animals, so we don't have to worry with leaving her Chuckit toys in her toy box.  We only had a problem with the</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is about the size of a tennis ball. It's very durable. My dog LOVES this ball, and I think the texture is the reason why. He is OBSESSED with it, to use a very overused but apt term. This is the ball he puts in your lap all night long expecting you to throw it for him. Good for indoor or outdoor, but we have to be careful not to lose it outside due to its small size. Hope it lasts a long, long time!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">One throw and it was a fail. Design of ball doesn't allow for a bounce on lawn. the Breathe right gimmick sounds amazing but discovered if you get the right size ball for your dog or perhaps size down Dog can breathe just as well. So i let him chew on it like the other Chuckit Balls and 60lb chewer disintegrated it into tiny pieces in less than 22 minutes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My one year old German Shephard destroys toys almost instantly.  So far after 2 weeks she hasn't ripped apart this one.   Pros it squishes down, not a hard plastic, I think that is why she hasn't been able to rip it.  cons, it is a little small for my 70 lb dog.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 6 year old GSP is ball obsessed. He has one in his mouth most of the day. I thought this was a good idea as it would allow him to breath easier. He is not interested in it. He loves his ""whole"" ball but not the ""half"" ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball isn’t half as bouncy as the other closed orange  balls (obviously bc there’s no air inside).  I was hoping it would be a little more bouncy than it is, though.  My dog will ignore it, even if I use a chuckit launcher.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We bought this as a replacement for lost ball from the launcher. I love that my dog can breathe better with it and its a softer catch when your throwing it as I always worried about his teeth. Be sure to get the right size for your dog to avoid any kind of chocking hazard. Too many people buy the med ball when the avg med to large breed dog needs the XL!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I can't complain about this product.  It's not the ball's fault that my pit ate it.  I was hoping it would be strong enough to withstand her chewing, but it wasn't.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My German shepherd has destroyed dozens of balls, but not this one.  This is his all time favorite.  He loves it so much I bought him a second one.  It makes me smile to see him so happy with this ball.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We just bought this ball for out pup to play fetch in the backyard. The design of it would
Be great! But to our surprise we discovered that he couldn't see it after thrown! So we 
Did a little homework to find out that in a dog's color spectrum, they see more of a gold
Color instead of Orange. So it he d's to blend in with the grass. Dogs get more excited over 
Blues and greens ....since they can see them. Hope this helps someone else. Thanks!</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/chuckit-breathe-right-fetch-ball-dog/dp/172252

Personally I don't see it bounce very much at all, much less erratic. This toy seems only good as a chew toy, but there are things that are designed specially for that.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">...because the ball jumps around on its own, you do not have to put a lot of energy into the throw. You can use it in a small space indoors and throw it gently and still provide a chase. Also, my dog is a toy destroyer but for some reason, he doesn't destroy this one. Maybe the flexibility of the hollow center makes it less fun to chew on?
Also, because it is rubber-like, it does not retain the drool like cloth toys do.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our border collie is like a magnet with balls. He catches them every time without effort. This keeps him on his toes and makes fetching time more interesting.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This Chuckit Erratic Ball Dog Toy is wonderful!  I have 3 big dogs and they love playing fetch and just chewing on the ball!  This ball is great for big chewers and the erratic pattern when thrown keeps the dogs alert when playing - never know which way it will bounce!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have two GSD’s who are heavy chewers. They love these and they last forever!  I have four and may buy more as one dog likes to hoard them!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a couple of high energy dogs who love the erratic bounce of this Chuck It ball! And so far it has held up to our hard chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was really excited to get this to play with my blue heeler! I had recently purchased the Chuckit! launcher with various balls and my dog and I are SO happy (me because I can throw farther!). Unfortunately, I had a hard time picking this ball up with my launcher without stepping on the launcher when picking it up. 
I would highly recommend the whistler ball! It makes a whistle noise and is the perfect weight for me to launch it effectively (and far)!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is THE BALL (tm) that all the puppies want to play keep away with - it doesn’t particularly throw well or fit in the chuck it neatly, but THEY LOVE IT SO MUCH. It’s very entertaining. Like all chuckit stuff, it’s tough and hasn’t shown any wear despite being beat up on by multiple dogs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs love the ball and the unpredictability of the bounce. I rated it a four because it has two holes in it and water can get inside.  Wished it didn’t so we could use it in the pool like the orange balls.

The dogs were curious with the strobe in the dark, but as hard as they are on toys, the strobe only lasted a few days.  The ball is still in good shape to play, just doesn't light up any more.

It's a great concept but they need to come up with something that won't die after such a short time.  They still like the bounce but they also love their other rubber bouncy ball that's a bit cheaper.  Would I buy this again for the little bit of extra money that this costs just to have the lights?

I feed her with this style treat ball pretty often and she is quite skilled with these. So far this is my favorite because you can actually clean it! You'd be surprised how hard some of these suckers are to clean. 

The rubber bumper is made out of Kong material and is pretty durable as my dog does periodically just chew on it. I've seen larger unattended dogs somehow knock out the blue orb and do some damage to it. I recommend supervising your dog the first few times and show them how it works.

Literally will not set it down. Sleeps with it, eats with it, and plays with it literally all day long.

She would spend the entire day fetching tennis balls if we would let her. We got her this pack of tennis balls as part of her birthday presents. It was, by far, the most exciting part of the day for her. She was so excited, she didn't know where to start! I would recommend for anyone else who has a tennis ball fiend like ours.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">When playing fetch, my dog is in the habit of chewing the ball while returning it to me. These balls fall apart quickly and are only good for a session or two of fetch. My dog is not a particularly strong chewer. These balls do not hold up to light to moderate chewing.

They also have a very strong and unpleasant odor.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I like that it came with a lot but my dog went through them pet quicky. They lasted a while just because there was so many of them. I would rather pay 15-20 dollars for one tennis ball if I knew my dog couldn't break it or dent it</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Overall as a tennis ball they are great but I am not sure about the ""pressure-less"" claim. I had bought these for my power chewer Vizsla and he has figured out how to split them in half with the felt still on in about a half hour. (haven't actually timed it but it feels that long). I was looking for a solution to the problem but these are not it, luckily its a bag of 18 so it should last a little while but not as long as it should. The reason why I am rating them high is I am sure they would be fine for any other dog just not mine.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Purchased these for our 1 yo lab to throw in the lake and her to retrieved ,as our original tennis balls got old.  These Didn’t last , and all she did was fetch and bring back   Suggest not for large dogs</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog removed the green fuzzy skin.

I was looking to add some variety to our collection, and liked that the Tricky Treat Ball wasn't so clunky or hard (noisy) like some of the other balls and wobblers. Unfortunately, most of the treats got stuck outside the dispensing tube, making it an incredibly frustrating toy for both me and my dogs. It's nearly impossible to clean the inside and it didn't stand up to regular wear and tear. After one session, it had gouges and scrapes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is not intended for heavy chewers but for dogs that need puzzles to challenge their mind. My shepherd/retriever mix needs fun challenges. Her activity level is higher than my other dog so I’m always looking for “puzzle toys”. I put about 10 Zukes mini training treats inside and it keeps her entertained while I eat breakfast. I keep it up out of her reach during the day so she knows it’s not for chewing up. She has other toys for chewing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is indeed tricky... There is one small hole where the treats fall out, what makes it particularly challenging is that the lip of the hole continues for about an inch and traps all the treats inside making it really difficult to actually get them out. Gizmo tries it for a little while and then gets frustrated and looks at me for help. I can't get the treats out either. Patience is not our virtue. Now we just spread gooey treats (like peanut butter) in the little craters on the surface of the ball instead. Way more fun and less frustration.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought a bunch of toys a couple weeks ago to give out slowly to my dogs. I gave this to my 15lb terrier mix with her breakfast food in it while I took a shower. Just in the 10 minutes I was in the shower she was able to chew through the side. Definitely do not recommend to any dogs that might be destructive. Unfortunately this was a total waste of money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought this because Bailey is incredibly intelligent and loves the treat dispensing toys. I wanted something that didn't make the noise that hard plastic makes as she lifts it up and drops it on the floor.  Unfortunately, in less than ten minutes she chewed a hole in it. Chewy customer service was great when I called about it, but they replaced it with another one, which I can't use.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this after I was dog sitting and my client had this same exact toy for their pitbull. I bought it for my heeler and both balls have lasted a long time and are sturdy. I bough this months ago and it looks just as good as it did the day I got it. My only complaint is that the treats seem to come out too easy so I wish the hole was a little smaller but I will try using bigger treats and see if that helps.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a 60 lb pup who loves to play fetch, and is a power chewer. Have tried many toys and balls which ended up torn and trashed, but this one lasts! And it doubles up as a slow feeder (we trimmed the inside lip so treats come out a little easier; without doing that it was really difficult for even kibble to fall out). We got multiple so that should the day come where our current ball finally gets demolished, we have backups.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this because my dog needed something that would challenge her to get treats better than her Kong. Unfortunately the treats fall out easily just like the Kong. She never chews on her Kong but pretty much obliterates everything else including this Omega Paw treat ball. Lasted only minutes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a fun toy that I feed my dog a meal of kibble out of.  It is fun for him as it it rolls well and it is challenging as there hole has a large internal piece that catches the food so it doesn't just fall out easily it takes some rolling and sometimes shaking.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was rated to be for giant and large breeds, so I thought it would stand up to my half grown pittie. Within 5 minutes, he had chewed a hole in it. I definitely expected better for the price I paid.</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/omega-paw-tricky-treat-ball-dog-toy/dp/51233

We ended up buying a second one to keep at my parents house. The exterior ball is collapse able so it has been great while he’s growing. The interior ball still squeaks months later and honestly he’s so entertained trying to figure out how to get the inner ball out he’s enthralled for at least 30 min which is a lot for a puppy</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Hiding the squeaker ball inside a larger ball is a fine idea. It took my young greyhound longer than usual to destroy the squeaker. The good news is that it is easy to find inexpensive replacement squeakers on the internet. For this toy I needed to enlarge the hole for the squeaker with an exacto knife, then the ones listed at 15-16mm long are the right size. 
After a couple of hours, the outer shell, which is very soft, so no bouncing, is starting to tear.
The holes in the outer shell are large enough that a greyhound lower jaw can get caught inside, which doesn't look comfortable. Dog breeds with shorter snouts shouldn't have this problem, but they may have difficulty getting a grip good </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought 2 of these balls, one for my heeler and the other for my corgi mix. My corgi struggled to be able to squeak the ball on the inside so he ended up chewing the green ball apart until he got the yellow ball out. 
My heeler loved the ball and could squeak the yellow ball with no problem. BUT eventually my corgi chewed up both balls. Now all we have left are the yellow balls from the inside.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Normally, I love the Kong products. They are extremely durable, and allow my dogs some play time before they are able to destroy it. This one however, the outer part of the ball is so thin, that my dog pretty much had destroyed it in less than 5 minutes trying to get to the inside ball.   It might work for less aggressive players, but didn't for my dogs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Madison loves it, but a little flimsy, my pit bull would tear it apart in seconds, but a decent toy for my 41 lb Madison</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I thought Kong Toys were built to withstand heavy chewers. However, this particular toy was demolished in 5 minutes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Another favorite of our new puppy. There is a ball inside the outer ball. Outer ball is flexible and has hole just large enough for her to get her mouth around to squeeze it. It has held up well to her razor blade puppy teeth too. Truly impressed. This ball is about the size of a large grapefruit</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We play keep away with our 40 lb Brittany. This is his favorite toy ever!  He loves that's its squishy and he can get an easy grip for running and playing with it. He has not even offered to try to tear it up- he loves it!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Got this in the mail yesterday 5/9/2020, The toy was much smaller then it looked online tossed it to my doggo and with in 5 mins the ball was already ripping.  Sad.  Not worth it in my opinion.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I expected my corgi to destroy this ball in 5 minutes but he didn’t and now it’s his favorite toy.  I almost didn’t buy it but I am glad I did. He still hasn’t destroyed it.  Please make more toys like this. I will buy it!!</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/kong-wiggi-tumble-assorted-dog-toy/dp/236405

He is not allowed to chew his toys except bones and he managed to cut the rubber in an hour.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The nerf ball is their favorite toy.

They continue to play with it nonetheless.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I wish it were just a tad smaller for him to carry back to me (he has trouble getting his mouth around it) mind you he is a large dog, but it is still one of his favorites.  Not too heavy and of course, he loves the squeak.   Easy to throw, nice material and holds up well to his lab/pit jaw.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I just LOVE my ball. It’s easy to grab and chew. Mom throws it and I toss it around and chase it more. Sometimes I take it close to tease her, but I don’t let go.

The interior ball is covered with a black felt-like fabric which he was able to tear away after a few uses causing the inner ball to crack open on its seam. The squeaker is gone.

My only problem with it might just be, a my dog issue. Our little girl is a bichon/shih mix and I feel if I not watching she could break it in half very easy.

I DONT leave it out all day or when I’m gone due to it being plastic and having a battery in it. She’s a 75lb Pitbull and would anyone with sense knows that ball would be be gone or in pieces.

I really like this toy except I wish it had an on/off button.

They were running from it and chasing it non stop for an entire afternoon. Its been 4 hours and they are still playing with it. 

The entire ball is hard plastic, so if you have a power chewer, not sure how well it would hold up. I intend to purchase the large size for my pittie since she likes the sounds. She is a power chewer so i already know that i will not leave the toy unattended in case she cracks it in half and tries to eat it.

Like on everything she can reach!! I was skeptical of this ball because it was not a solid ball; it has some squish to it. Buuttttt it is amazing!! She LOVES this ball!

I needed a ball that was soft enough to throw in the house, but strong enough to hold up to his teeth.  This ball is perfect. I had my doubts because it feels so soft and light, but after a few weeks of regular play, there aren't even any teeth marks on it.  I don't leave it laying around for him, it just comes out for supervised play time.

My dogs couldn't play with them and eventually just let them sit on the side of the yard which they never do with even the most boring of toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">my year old Golden Retriever spends hours playing with this toy all over the backyard! I didn't know/think it would be that big of a hit.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Samoyed loves this egg.

I was hoping the egg would hold his interest as he likes to chase things like balls and flirt poles. He loves it! He can't get his mouth around it so he can't destroy it and the shape makes it skitter erratically which he loves. I will sometimes put it in his crate if I have to run a quick errand and he will happily chase it around the crate. It is hard plastic so it rather loud on wood floors and against the crate, but I don't mind. A very large dog could puncture this toy if you choose a small enough one that they can pick up.

I have heard such good things about Jolly toys and that they are also super durable so I thought we would try this one out. He could care less about it. I don't think he even realizes it is a toy.

It is a hard plastic.   My dogs ignore it.  My guys chew the handles off the jolly balls so I thought this might be a good alternative.   Instead it was a total waste of money.  It's too big to pick up in their mouth and doesn't squish.  Very disappointed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pup Jem chases this thing all over the yard pushing it with her nose - so funny to watch.  Hard plastic but she’s a Lab and can pick it up to carry it.

She will chase it if I push it, but she doesn’t actively engage with it at all. I will be regifting it most likely as it was bigger than I thought. Maybe slightly larger than a football.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My power chewer LOVED this toy. It was just big enough that it was too hard to get a good grip on it with his mouth, so it ""squirted"" out of his mouth and he chased it all over the yard.
Unfortunately after a year or so he was able to make a few small dents in it, and eventually did destroy it when we weren't watching. But that's a SUPER success in our book.
We'll be buying a replacement for sure.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Dane just looks at it and walks away. She loves toys.

She destroys stuffed toys and rope toys in minutes so we don’t bother with those anymore... she enjoys a variety of Chuck it and long balls most.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 60lbs GSG mix and this little ball is his favorite fetch ball. It’s small enough for him to get the entire ball in his mouth so he can easily squeak it. He loves the noice it makes. It has a very good bounce to it. 
I like the fact that the surface is slick so it makes it hard to chew it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a power chewer. The squeaker lasted about 10 mins before it was squeakless. The ball has lasted so far and it has been about two weeks.

To those chewer moms and dads out there you know thats a long time! When they really get going playing with it they love that it squeaks. Great toy for the price!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball has some good weight to it making it easier to throw further than some of the lighter weight balls available. I am using it for my five month old labradoodle who loves to fetch. However, I am concerned that in order to squeak this ball, which she really enjoys on the return, that she may develop tendonitis in her jaw! Just kidding but not really. She literally can’t make it squeak. The ball is hard and only an adult dog with a power jaw could make it squeak! Good for throwing though.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">my pitbull chewed through these in less than 10min so probably these are made for smaller dogs or a different breed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought these balls for my boxer mix because he had another pair he got at Christmas time. These didn’t last more than 3 days before he split them in half. I’m not sure if the material/quality changed since the last ones I bought but I would not recommend if your dog does any type of chewing/chomping down on balls. Made for light play only!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Jack Russell had these balls destroyed in less than an hour. I have been searching for as long as I've had her for a ball that she can play with for more than a day. I thought kong would be the one, but nope. It's probably a good ball for almost every other dog, but not for ones that just want to see the world burn. ""Extra durable"" isn't extra enough I guess.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I thought these were similar to a ""holiday"" edition Kong ball that I can't find anymore, but they were not as durable. They seemed hard enough, but one pup had chunks out of this in less than 10 minutes and the other within 20-- only because she enjoyed running around with it longer. I guess we need to stick with the Kong Extreme.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball seems well made.  Per another review saying the small ball was too small for a small pup, I ordered medium for my 13 lb. Mini Schnauzer.  Well he has trouble wrapping his mouth around the medium that I ordered.   I should have ordered the small and since I have opened package and he has been playing with it, I doubt I can return.

I've bought quite a few, so I'll be posting a bunch of reviews.
The squeaker lasted literally 3 minutes. Literally.
The ball itself was damaged in about 20 minutes. 
The ball broke along the seams (like a tennis ball). When this happens, my dog's lower jaw can get stuck inside the ball, and she panics. I am not fond of this.
Two stars because she really loved it for the short time she had it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pup loved this ball but unfortunately, it only lasted a week.  He likes to chomp down to make it squeak and it ended up coming apart and we had to throw it away.  I would suggest this ball for pups that don't have a strong jaw grip.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My big golden loves squeaks but he chomps them so hard that the squeak goes pretty quick.  The only way I can make this squeak is to stand on it on a hard floor but he gives one chomp and it squeaks for him very satisfactorily.  He has chomped on it a lot but it's still in one piece, too, full of very many more squeaks.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my golden retriever's new favorite ball!  Very durable, good quality, &amp; cool bounce to it!  I ordered another one, as well as a smaller size for the golden puppy we are getting next month.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Don't know what happened here, but after a day or two our dog showed no more interest. It is somewhat difficult to make it squeak, and that might be the problem.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I nicknamed my dog Jeter as he would play catch all day.  He catches 99% — even if the throw is a bit off.  This ball is soft but firm so I don’t have to be concerned with break his teeth, the texture helps me feel it’s not likely to slide down his throat, and he likes to squeak retrieving for another throw.  We both love this ball!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball lasted less than five minutes, we did not even get to throw it.  My little Pug/Chiwawa was so excited to get a new ball, he ran around the house non-stop for 3-4 minutes with it in his mouth and then when he dropped it for a throw, the part where the squeaker is was caved in, almost severed completely around the whole fault line in the seam.  If I could give minus 5 I would.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Shepard broke the squeaker on the first day. Then she proceded to bite into it st the seam so there is now a huge hole. 3 stars because it still bounces and she still likes it! But it is not as  ""tuff"" as her!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Nice and durable, fun for the pup. Bounces and rolls in different directions.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs love to destroy balls, love to chew on anything they can! They love playing with squeaky balls and this one is surprisingly still around! They don't grab it out of the toy box as  their first choice, but when it's out, it's nice to know it isn't getting shredded!</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/zippypaws-zippytuff-squeaker-ball-dog/dp/182214

Happy pup, Happy humans!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I would consider our pup a light to moderate chewer, definitely not overly aggressive by any means. Because of the treat holes, and the flimsy-ness is the material, this toy did not last more than 2-3 hours.

We have a 7 month old goldendoodle, whom is very mild yet loves his toys! This one is fun and loves it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Shepherd loves footballs &amp; this has been hers &amp; our absolute favorite! It's nice that it has a hole on one end so while playing &amp; she gets the ball full of slobber, you can stick your finger in there &amp; toss it that way without touching the ball! It is a nice size &amp; easier than other balls for her to grab &amp; carry. She's had all different kinds &amp; colors over the years &amp; this one looks the most like a true football too! Definitely going to get her a couple more of these for Christmas! Others we have also get dirtier faster because of grooves &amp; crevasse's but this one is so smooth! Love it! Fast shipping from Chewy, as always!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves this football!

However after much play they wore down the handle and it was hanging so I cut it off to prevent my dogs or the neighbors dog from choking.  However four of these dogs won’t play with this ball no matter how hard I try. My neighbors dog is a lab and refuses to touch it. My Yorkie used to love chasing it playing socca with him and grabbing the handle.   I noticed the ball was made with a new rubber material not like the older one I had.  So now no dog will play with it.  Are there any other balls made like the jolly tuss and play ball with the older rubber plastic type material. ?  If so I would very much like to try </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a large pit bull/boxer mix who is extremely rough on toys - ones listed as ""indestructable"" rarely last more than a few minutes. The Jolly Pets Tug-n-Toss ball has lasted through several hard play sessions, with only a few puncture holes to show for it. It's covered with scratches and scrapes, but still in good shape. The construction material keeps its shape with no collapse or loss of bounciness. Dougie loves this toy. The only real damage he's done to it is to have chewed off part of the handle, but it will still be fun for him for a long time to come. This is one of the few toys I'll always have on hand of for his enjoyment.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Bought two of these, one for each dog.  Unfortunately I have an aggressive chewer, so while this was really fun for my gentle chewing German Shepherd, my black lab healer mix chewed the handle off immediately.  So if anyone has a dog that really enjoys chomping on their toys, be careful and always watch your dogs during play time with toys and/or hard treats.  I do recommend this toy but again NOT for aggressive chewers &amp; please always watch your fur babies while they play or eat.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Not worth the $22... We were excited for our six month old Dane mix to get this toy. Within a half hour he ripped the handle in pieces. Luckily he was being supervised and we pulled the remains out of his mouth! Very disappointed in the quality.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This huge ball is a hit with my pup! It's almost soccer ball sized so I kick it around for him but he also plays by himself. He can't bite the ball, just the handle so he runs around pushing it with his mouth. He loves this toy!
So far, the handle has lots of bite marks and I imagine he will be able to destroy it eventually but it keeps his attention and he wags his tail tons while playing with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our son has a new rescue dog and I sent this as a gift!  I watched the video of Corn(the new grand pup) begin to play with this toy, loving it, and then within 4 and a half minutes he had torn the handle off!!  Not a tough or strong ball at all!  I was very disappointed, to say the least.  This product did not meet my satisfaction and did not meet the description of what a great ball for tough chewers as stated on your website!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I ordered this toy for my dog and it has quickly become his new favorite! He absolutely loves playing fetch with this ball. The handle makes it easy for him to carry. He has punctured the ball in a few places but its still holding up well. I do put it away after we play so that he doesn't chew it up.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 70# Pitt mix loooooved this!!! About two minutes after he opened it, he discovered he could use it as a wrecking ball on all the shelves. Definitely an out door toy, instant favorite!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is probably one of the best dog toys in existence. Our border collie LOVES the handle and the weight helps to tire her out a bit. Ball is life, so we play with her jollyballs (this and the rope one) multiple times every single day.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog destroyed this within minutes - chewed the handle right off. Will still play with the ball a bit but this toy did not stay intact long.

Seems like a nice quality ball (none of them destroyed it yet) &amp; it does smell like mint.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this ball based off of its name as a ""tough dog chew toy"". When I got it, I was a bit put out by two ugly mistakes in the silicone. They looked like they would be weak spots that my pup, Newt, could pick off. But to my surprise, this ball holds up!

This is the first and only ball that has lasted months! We love this ball so much that we’ve bought 2 and plan to buy more.

We are just glad it held up!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Fia likes chasing her new ball but it is smaller then I expected so it gets lost under furniture. Also the Happy Birthday wore off the first day. Not a $10 ball in my opinion but maybe I will find it holds up awhile as we have only had it a little over a week.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Ball is just a little too big for my little dog.

Finally a ball she likes but cannot destroy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So hard to find dog toys made in USA. One of our dogs always has a ball in her mouth.

This is hard, but has enough give that she can squeeze it - even though we barely can.

The second my dog went to pick it up, the rope fell out.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I've bought this particular toy for my tug-o-war lovin' dogs many times and it's usually held up pretty well considering the energy my one particular dog puts into trying to destroy it. Unfortunately, just a day after a bought a new one, the dogs were playing tug-o-war and the rope pulled out because the knot was not big enough. Now I'm left with a ball that is incredibly hard to play with and a rope that the dogs have minimal interest in. This has happened before but not so shortly after receiving it!

Highly recommend for larger, strong dogs who like a good game of tug or for dogs who like to roughhouse with big toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have an ACD that loves to destroy toys.  This toy is definitely his favorite.  Thank goodness it can withstand his chewing and he grabs the rope to sling it back and forth.

Be warned the squeak is more of a discordant screech but the dog loves it so I'll be smiling as my ears bleed. I also have a Mighty ring (how I was introduced to Mighty) and am ordering a Mighty bone. Tuffy and Kong have come and go but the Mighty is here to stay (as is my tinnitus).</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This ball is a BALL to play with! Bigger than a softball, smaller than a basketball, so probably better for med to large dogs. We like this toy for indoor play. When the weather isn't cooperating, we can roll this big, fun ball down the hall and our dog will do this thousands of times and never get bored. The outside is a soft fleece that has held up extremely well to how much we play. The ball itself is a giant squeak-ball, so also fun to squeak and throw for added excitement. We love this big MIGHTY ball!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">First I love mighty brand toys as they last and are fairly safe for dogs . ( I pick up when they are done playing ) . But my healer girl loves this ball , so of corse I do also.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Somehow,  I have no idea how, he managed to get the squeaker out of the ball without ripping the material. Its literally moving around between the ball and the material. He's the Herry Houdini of squeaky killing. Just got it today and within an hour, he killed it. Within the first few minutes the ball would collapse and slowly inflate back up.  Right where my finger is is where the squeaker piece isn't longer in the ball. Hes not even chewing the ball hes just playing with it. Hes a total nut ball. I thought it might work because the ball is bigger than his head.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">only made it for 2 play sessions. We definitely had fun kicking it for the first session. By session number 2 there was a hole in it and completely torn apart</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Love it. The sound is great when you mush it down    Can grab it when it’s flattened down and run around with it as it expands</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Diogi had a ball like this before, but it was smaller, probably 4 inches. He loves this big ball and can get his huge mouth around it to make it squeak! Sister Honey, AKA Destructor of Toys, can’t get her mouth around it to tear it up. I hear it squeaking several times a day. Now, it IS big, so it isn’t suitable for smaller dogs. Diogi is a 83 pound boxer/something-very-big mix.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have an large Aussie puppy (75 pounds) who is a chewer. This ball entertains him (he loves to make it squeak), and so far, it's holding up very well to him chasing and grabbing it with his teeth. It's a heavy ball, with a harder surface under the tough cloth, which probably makes it more durable. Glad I bought this one!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves these balls. I’ve had three. He inevitably tears them apart as he does all toys. They are a nemesis to be destroyed. But they last as long as any with him. He’s so ridiculously happy with these. Why? It is very easy to bite and it is very very easy to squeak. The squeaking will drive you crazy. But his face and obvious enchantment with this overrides that. I guess I was obnoxious as a kid as well. Buy it.</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/mighty-squeaky-stuffing-free-plush/dp/117807

When my dad bought this basketball, he wasn’t sure if it would hold up to my rough play, but bought it anyway because it was a Nylabone. Well...he was right, the narrow area that I love to grab and tug and shake all over ended up cracking from side to side, I wasn’t happy! :-( Dad thinks it’s because of the three tiny nylon connectors that were inserted into the ball to connect a silly cardboard label - they connected it right through the seam that broke!! Why did they do that??? Anyway, I am still allowed to play with it since it’s still in one piece, but dad says he will take it away if I am actually able to tear the rubber - it is tough, but not quite</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I'm sad that both balls I bought broke open at the handle seam right away, but my dog still loves it.

Got this for my dog's birthday, not as a chew toy but strictly for fetching and running with it.  It came apart at the seams within 4 days and is worthless now.  I could've understood if it was a chew toy and it came apart, but he didn't chew it at all.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The medium size is really small.

He’s a chewer and tugs at his toys to rip them apart. He loves this toy and loves to make it bounce on the ground. He has pulled and chewed and it hasn’t budged. We have had it for several months now, with no signs of wear. Highly recommend the basketball one over the football one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">this toy seemed promising as the pups loved it, however, after 2 days its already broken and it split in half were it was fabricated to be together.

Visible in the yard and durable!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our baby Sadie, who loves balls, thought this was a great find. She is a Boxer and likes when there is an appendage or some small place to grab a toy by instead of opening her whole mouth to grab it. This did the trick with the small indentation on the ball. She was so excited and this toy is proving to be very durable. Looks brand new and she is tough on toys.

With that being said, this ball looks like crappy quality but it’s great because my dog can get a good grip on it and sink his teeth into it. I’ve used the ball about a dozen times now and it has small little punctures in it but no tears or rips. And he bites down and pulls with all his 85lb body weight. I’ve used Nero balls and only get 3-5 times out of the ball before it breaks.

After a half hour in the yard playing with it, it has holes everywhere- but that being said, he absolutely LOVES this ball! I purchased this, along with the round 10” ball and the purple odd shaped ball for my three Rottweilers and they all loved them! I think if the ball was maybe a couple inches wider, he wouldn’t have been able to get his mouth around it and there would be no holes.  I was hoping he would have taken to the 10” ball and one of my girls would have taken to this one  because they can’t get their mouths around it, thus not being able to pierce it</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have 3 Great Danes that are super power chewers, most toys don’t last long.  This is a great size for them and it truly is indestructible.  The shape makes for fun throwing, as it wobbles and moves in unexpected ways.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 18 month old Portuguese Water Dog made pretty light work of this “Virtually Indestructible” toy. Don’t get me wrong, he loved it, but his love was too much for this football shaped ball to handle. Within a few seconds he managed to work deep groves into the material and in minutes was able to make strategically placed holes that allow him to get his mouth around it and pick it up.  If you’re like me and trying to find toys your hard chewer cannot destroy, this is not the one. Unfortunately, I think the word “Virtually” in the description is the key here.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This eggy is awesome.

So great for her agility and rehab after her knee replacement.  Keeps her engaged and active.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I should have read reviews posted on here before purchasing this. I also thought it would be a more Kong like material, it definitely is not.

It's impossible to play throw and fetch with it. It is also made from heavy duty plastic and is too hard.

He chews on this thing non-stop and (luckily) hasn't had the urge to chew off the ends (as he does with every other toy). So far, it's been 6 months and this thing is going strong. It's worn in now but he hasnt gotten a single tooth through the ball or anything.

She kills the squeakers within minutes. I was hoping she would like the crackly noise, but she wasn’t impressed. The balls are very sturdy and hold up well, even playing outside.

He loves just sitting there chewing on them, crunch crunch crunch! He tore the felt outer off pretty quickly, but the ball seems to be made of a resilient rubber, so he's yet to destroy the ball itself - which is great! I suppose I should expect that of a Kong product. I'd definitely get these again - and will, at some point. I think the best part, aside from durability and how much my dog enjoys these, is that they're not terribly loud! Far from annoying like squeakers can be.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 8 month old lab mix puppy loved the crunch these made, however she totally destroyed them in under 20 minutes.

Also the covering on the ball is coming off already in one  piece.  I will not purchase these again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I should have known better.

This one is perfect because the ball gets just the right amount of bounce when I swing it by the rope, so my dogs go nuts trying to catch it and follow it around. 
And also because the ball slips to the other side of the rope certain times they’ll just boop the ball and have to keep chasing it, but when they catch the rope we play tug for a bit before they’re instructed to drop it. 
Once they’re nice and tired, I put it away. My “four stars” is for the rope...

The size was perfect for her (6-inch size, 60 pound Pointer), and the ball held up well against her abuse.

The blue one I have is solid, sturdy, and has lasted several months. This one had a puncture hole in it within 5 minutes - completely different than the blue one and a total waste of money. It’s actually such poor quality that I wonder if it’s not even the real jolly brand!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this toy for my 9 dogs as one of their Christmas gifts.

He constantly works his jaw on this thing and he's never chewed pieces off of it, just cracked it after some time.

Will definitely be ordering several more when they come back in stock.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It’s a great bouncing ball, a good size for medium &amp; large dogs. To get the crunch sound the ball has to be squeezed hard so the nubbiez inside touch each other.

I tried introducing the tire toy, they don’t like the bell; the smiley face cus they do seem to like squeakers, but they walk off from it after I quit playing with them. I also think they may like the electronic balls, but I have not introduced those yet, either.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Lots of fun toys to keep the pup playing for hours.  The newspaper crinkles &amp; squeaks.  It also contains very funny articles.

The balls that talk keeps his interest for a long time, he just can’t get enough.

Even when up against a determined chewer.  This thing is heavy duty and, as such, it weighs significantly more than a tennis ball, so it isn't one you want them to ""catch"", but rather ""fetch"".

This is a perfect ball for dogs that like to chomp! It is a bit heavy to catch. So, use it appropriately.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I purchased this giggle ball for your Hall of Fame X2 boy :) MYLO, and it could have really hurt him had I thrown it towards him.

Best bet would be buy other balls. Launcher works great throws ball far and provides lots of exercise</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog received this as a Christmas present. I love the product. Only negative I found so far is the ball was a dud. Didn't bounce at all. I use a regular tennis ball with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">While it lasted. We did one round of fetch. I left it In the back yard and 1 of three pups must have been too rough with it and broke the cup the ball fits in. I’ll definitely be ordering a new one when I can.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I am giving this item a 5-star review because I bought this item for the thrower itself and not the ball. The thrower is awesome and being able to hold an extra ball is a huge bonus because sometimes we lose one and then all the fun is over! I do agree with all of the other comments that the ball is not the best. Our lasted maybe 6 trips to the park before it got a hole and didn't throw right so we have since tossed it. Thankfully we have tons of tennis balls to replace it with!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The Air Strike Launcher Dog really doesn't bring much to the table over your normal throwing arm. Take the money you'd spend on this toy and buy a couple more tennis balls or something unique like the Hartz Dura Play balls instead. They're super tough and (according to the package) taste like bacon. Our dog loves his. This toy has been relegated to gathering dust in our pantry.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Works great for keeping up with our puppy lab who wants to fetch balls all day long.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this for two reasons. One, I watch dogs often and some are more energetic than others and my arm will get tired way before they do. And two, I like to play with my neighbor’s dog that loves balls. But he will drop his ball right at the base of our chain link fence on his side, and I can’t reach it to pick it back up. This works perfectly to reach over and scoop the ball up to throw it again!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Great if you buy different tennis balls for it. The nerf one broke in literally one retrieve. My BC bit it right in half. Guess I'll order some chuckit balls instead for it! If it hadn't been on sale for so cheap, i would've just bought another chuckit launcher. Works the same and the tennis balls actually are useful</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is great for helping pick balls up off of the ground so you don't have to keep bending over. Not long enough to prevent you from having to bend at all, but it really helps! The ball that came with it is just okay, nothing special.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dad’s dog absolutely loves this!!!

Still, I was a bit disappointed by this design, because it's flat side didn't cause the erratic bounce it promised and instead functioned like any other ball. The dogs don't seem to mind, but after having retrieved it from the gazillionth roll beneath the furniture, I'm ready for West Paw to fetch a new design (hint: think, football)!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Smiley loves the ball.

Ball on the right is a traditional tennis ball (several months old) that has no bounce because it was chewed, but is in one piece and can still be played with.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I like the way the balls feel and they do not smell which is a plus.  Sadly that's all I can say about them that is good.  They must be tasty though because our GSD will destroy one in minutes where a tennis ball will last for weeks.  She'll fetch it a couple times then rip it apart.  We have one of the 4 balls left that we are trying to save as long as we can but the rest are gone.  Our lab doesn't care about the ball but that may be because of GSD is a beast.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I washed them as soon as they arrived. Gave 1 to my 2 yr old Aussie and went to shower. By the time I was done it was in several pieces. These just did not last.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a very gentle, non-chewing labradoodle and this toy lasting less than 2 minutes before all of the felt came off. I would give it 0 stars if I could. Worthless.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a Cocker Spaniel who loves to play ball.  I do not like to order or buy “tennis balls” in the store because they smell, have lots of stuff for her to pull off the outside and come from China.  These balls have no smell, almost no outside covering to pull off and made in USA.  I will order again when these get worn off.</span>]",balls,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/greenbone-assorted-tennis-balls-dog/dp/207640

Her tiny terror teeth are built to sink into this soft plush rubber. Its made of a tough soft rubber that's great for chewing but not great as a frisbee. I've heard they learn to chase and catch the Frisbee when you roll it on the rim first, and then build up to throwing. But this is too soft to roll, it just splats on the ground. Just another chew toy for now. I guess if she learns how to catch a frisbee, this will be a good one to practice since its unlikely to hurt.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was pretty bummed when my Kong toys came blue instead of pink, but I just didn’t realize they were assorted colors.

To me, a tough chewer meets these characteristics: A) powerful jaws, B) desire to shred greater than desire to engage in ""normal"" play with that toy, and C) patience to find a way to shred. They are intentionally looking to destroy the toy and are not content to just nom on it in ""normal"" play.

It'd be cool to be able to choose the colors. For some reason, my dogs do prefer certain colored toys to others, I'm not sure why. Like I said, I buy multiples of the same toy and they usually prefer the red-based toys (vs greens). Luckily, we got a red one when we purchased.

I’m not sure why people think this is a chew toy.

She destroys everything we get her in no time, but so far, this has lasted the test. I don't expect it to last a super long time, but we've had it a few weeks now and so far it's in great shape! We do make her give it to us after playing or I'm sure she'd have it chewed to pieces in minutes, but for fetching this is great and will definitely purchase again!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These frisbees are awesome!  The only kind my Dobie will catch. I always make sure though to put them away when done. Because it doesn’t take much time for some sharp teeth to destroy them. With me, they tend to last about a month. But i am usually throwing to her twice a day, and always at least once. Petsmart now carries this item in-store. But be aware, at least the petsmart i go to charges 15.95 for them. That’s quite a large difference compared to around $10.95 online. All you have to do is show them the online price and they will honor it. Definitely worth it considering a difference of $5.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is our third one of these. My golden loves this frisbee so much! We have all sorts of frisbees for the dogs to play with, but this is by far her favorite.  My lab unfortunately loves to chew on it, which this frisbee is not built to withstand. So, we have had to get extras to make sure we have one around for my golden.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">He liked it at first and will play with it in the house sometimes.

He's never been so excited about a toy! :)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog LOVES this frisbee. So much so that she ripped it up in the first week. We'll probably buy another one because she loves it so much, but we've had to make it an outdoor only toy and not one that she can take with her or sit with since it ripped to shreds pretty quickly.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We lost a previous frisbee in the water thinking it would float and it didn't, so thought this would be a good solution. But, it doesn't fly very well at all, is super tiny, and our pup was chewing up the rubber edge within minutes. We have the floater with the rope and much prefer that as a water toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog has a ChuckIt Disc that she has had for about 4 years and it is showing it's age - it is serrated all around and the plastic edges are starting to fall off.  But she carries it all over and is her favorite toy.  Knowing I had to replace it and couldn't find one exactly like it, I tried this one since it came from the same company and as soon as I took it out of the box she put it in her mouth and ran off waiting to play our usual game of ""fetch""  after her morning walk.  She carried it all over and alternated between the new and old ones - it's keeper and I am very pleased with it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">they arrived on time and the dogs love them. I bought this small size thinking they wouldn't be too small but I was wrong. BUT, the good news is the dogs love them anyway. I bought these because I already had one. They are durable and don't hurt my dogs and they can be used in the water. thanks</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our shiba has never played with a frisbee before, so I figured this would be a good 'starter' to get him used to the concept. He loves this, and it seems pretty tough and durable. Also, it smells like vanilla...

He feels it is more of a good beginner learning tool rather than something you'd want to use for an expert frisbee catcher. It is heavier than other frisbees, my husband worries that it might hurt our dog's mouth/teeth if he catches it in his mouth during high speeds. I don't know since I don't have much experience with dogs and frisbees. My dog has trouble picking this up off the ground if the lip is facing down, so I've taken to tossing it with the lip facing upwards so at least when it lands he can grab it easier. He isn't catching it mid-air yet, still learning about frisbees and what their purpose is, so he's mainly just chasing </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog loves this toy.  His human rolls it on the grass and he chases it to catch (has not mastered the air timing yet).  Over time, it got warped because of ground impacts but lasted us for a while (even with rough use).  I just bought 4 so we won't run out.  It is his only go-to toy in the yard.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Besides it being durable, it flies fast so my dog has to work harder to try to catch it, in turn tiring her out quicker.   Doesn’t throw like a regular frisbee but once you get the hang of it it’s all good</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is our second of this frisbee.  Our pup is a chewer and between her chewing and it staying outside in the cold all winter, we needed a new one.  It is durable and flies good.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It's not a great frisbee but it takes a while for the dogs to destroy. We primarily throw it in the pool for them to retrieve so it works well enough for that. And then it floats in the water. Others that we have purchased do not float so well.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This frisbee is much tougher than the Kong frisbee. I went through many Kong frisbees and they usually last a few weeks. This one I’ve had a month with no rips tears or holes in it. Very happy</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my German Shepherd’s favorite toy. It flies great and is easy for her to find.

This toy is his absolute favorite, even when it's thrown by an uncoordinated old woman (me).  Throw it overhand, vertically - NOT like a flying disk.  After a good throw, my dog gives the toy a ""squeak of approval"" as he runs it back to me.  When we're done with our walk, the toy goes back on the shelf so it doesn't become a chew toy.

Easy to throw and easy for him to pick up.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves squeaky toys, and I got this not even realizing the ball squeaked, until she played with it. Anyways, not even an hour into playing with it, she killed the squeaker and put a hole in the bottom of the ball. The top of the ball is made of more durable plastic, but the bottom (i am guessing because of the squeaker) is not very durable. If you have a dog that gets obsessed with chewing toys, don’t even waste your time or money on this one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I left this with my dog unsupervised for five minutes and she tore the entire outer portion off.

How do you throw it? Tossing like a frisbee doesn't work well. I will toss it perpendicular as opposed to horizontal (like a frisbee). Perpendicular seems to work as it will roll when it hits the ground and is easy for them to grab. The squeaker is fun but they have a hard time squeaking it. The disk part gets in the way of them grabbing the ball part. It really only squeaks when it hits the ground. I usually put their outdoor toys up after we've played with them. I left these ones out because I didn't care if they got destroyed. They have NOT got destroyed.  Dogs love them. We play with them ALL the dang time. Ugh.

Our pup doesn't swallow tons of water grabbng from the sides, and can grab from the top.  Really a well made frisbee for water or just regular playing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is perfect for my guy. Its lasted the longest too. He doesn't like fetch unless it involves tug of war. He's destroyed every Frisbee, and the ones he hasn't destroyed his teeth. This one has lasted very long. To top it off hes one of those dogs that naw at the threads till the toy unravels itself.  This took him a while to naw through. NOT BE CONFUSED W CHEWERS!. hes not a big chewer at all. He just enjoys unraveling everything.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This flyer is the best on the market. I have bought 6 different kinds and my German Shepherd tears them up.

And the price is well worth it. Great buy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My one dog made short work of chewing through the outer ring and pulling out clumps of mysterious, pointy stuff that looked like straw. It was difficult to even cut through it with sharp scissors to try to trim it back to the edge where it had come from. Very troubling.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We love this frisbee. My lab goes crazy when I bring it out! I like that it's soft with flexible material, so it doesn't hurt her mouth or damage her teeth like a hard frisbee would when she makes contact with it at 50 mph! This makes her RUN and wears her out;  and it has somehow been one of the very few toys that she hasn't immediately destroyed  ;-) -- so for that I'd give it 10 stars! Plus, the way it's designed, she can pick it up easily, it doesn't get stuck face down flat like some other frisbees do. Super happy with this!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Puppy love it so much we order three more.

My border collie/Kelpie mix hates it. Firstly, it flys like garbage. It doesn't stay flat and is so thick that my dog has a hard time catching it.
Secondly, you can't fly it long. My dog is really fast and usually goes out 25-30 yards, but you can't fly this thing more than ten, and if you do, it Will not stay flat. It also flys very slow and is cumbersome to handle. Maybe it would be Ok if you had a quarter acre yard, but otherwise it's worthless.
The only good thing about it is that it is a fairly good material. That being said, if your dog is really good at catching frisbee, stay away from this one, buy something else </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We've tried every configuration of frisbee offered for our Border Collies. So many of the ""donut"" types with no centers just warp after a week or two and then won't fly. The ones with centers seem to be the quickest for them to tear up, even with close supervision to stop destructive action. This Starmark flying disk is incredibly durable, flies great and I think will last 10x longer than anything else we've bought, if not longer. We will definitely buy this one again!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My lab loves this. He's obsessed. Throws great and was awesome for use in the pool! Other than a bunch of teeth marks, he hasn't destroyed it and my other dog plays tug of war with him.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I absolutely recommend this frisbee. Our 50lb Husky/Heeler isn't the best at catching, and the lightweight-ness and material this is made of gives him plenty of time to run and chase and attempt a catch. He'd love to tear into this more, but it almost seems like he can't get a good grip so we're expecting this to last several months. Will absolutely buy another when this one finally wears out.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Perfect for our border collie puppy!!! Very durable , lasts a long time and it’s softer than a regular frisbee. We switched to the Durango frisbee after using a hard frisbee that wore down our older border collie’s teeth! The Durango frisbee was her most favorite toy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I seem to be in the minority here, but I think this frisbee is pretty worthless.  Neither my husband or I can make it fly properly and my aussie cannot catch it well because it's so thick.  He can catch pretty much anything, so that surprised us.  I suppose if you needed a frisbee that floats or your dog just likes to carry something around, it might be worthwhile, but my dude wants to catch a frisbee in the air and then bring it directly back for another go.  I had high hopes, but this one is a disappointment for us.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My sheepdog loooves this frisbee the most out of all her other 4 frisbees. It glides very well and smoothly through the air. Super light and also floats in water. My girl isn’t a rough chewer so this frisbee is indestructible for her. We would tug it and there’d be tiny teeth marks but not enough to puncture or damage the frisbee.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This lightweight frisbee flies long and high. It is soft enough for ease in repeated catching, yet durable enough that my male GSD won't easily shred it with supervised play.  If left alone with it, he would thoroughly enjoy ripping it up, because sinking his teeth into it seems satisfying to him, but this frisbee has definitely outlasted many others.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My lab loves playing frisbee. He has gone through a couple of them while entertaining our neighbors. This frisbee seems more durable than ones we have previously owned. So far no damage.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I thought the foam would be lighter, so it’s not right for my min pin puppies, but a larger dog would enjoy it.</span>]",discs,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/starmark-easy-glide-durafoam-flying/dp/45482

This is by far one of the most durable.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Jawz fribees are the way to go, if you have a frisbee obsessed dog! I love this style for advanced throws. It's a sturdy frisbee &amp; has no bend to it, so that it can perform the throws it was designed for. It can hold a path, even in the wind. My border collie has no issue seeing or catching this. We have yet to have any puncture marks, after multiple uses. My only warning is that it doesn't float, so avoid throwing near water. Highly recommend - this will always be our go to frisbee!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Needed a good Frisbee for my Belgian Malinious who can chew through anything. I needed it durable but not too hard being concerned with her teeth. This is plastic but its not super hard. Bright orange lets her see it well. So far she hasn't been successful in damaging it. She loves frisbee, and tug of war, this fits the bill.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this flying disc for my dog thinking it would be easier for him to pick up than a ""people's Frisbee"", but it is not.

She had a problem with the lip on it, which made it difficult for her to catch. So she didn't like it at all. Our Boxer puppy on the other hand really liked chewing on it, but did not like it as a frisbee. They are both use to playing frisbee with the Hartz Tuff Stuff discs, which are more flat and not rubbery. I will probably just stick with the Hartz Tuff Stuff frisbees. Also, a little disappointed it barely had a glow after sitting in sunlight for a while. It does seem well made as long as you don't have a heavy chewer. It's a soft and flexible frisbee so it does not hurt dogs mouths. It might work well for your dog, </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog love it. It took her a bit to get used to the weight and material of the disk but she ended up loving it. I got the small one and thought it was still a bit large. It's also a bit on the heavy size compared to a regular plastic disc. Not recommended for tiny toy dogs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My labradors love the West Paw flying discs.   They fly well and are soft so they don’t hurt my dogs mouth she.

She is used to a lighter disc.  However, I will use it to train my younger larger dog.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Decent frisbee.
Pros; decent weight (240ish grams if i remember correctly), glows good I'll normally put it in front of my headlights for about 20 seconds and it'll last about 15 or so minutes, flies decent.
Cons; the lip on it makes it kinda odd to grip (i play alot of dg though so I'm picky obout how my grip is), not the best in a head wind, doesn't feel like the most durable plastic.

Definitely would suggest it if you got a pup that you have to run multiple times a day.
For any dg players think of a fairly flippy mid.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog normally destroys his frisbees. This one is going to be tough.

If/when she finally destroys this frisbee, I will definitely be ordering another one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">1st time we played with it, it cracked and started to fly poorly.

I highly recommend them.

I've never seen such a price tag on a frisbee, but I liked that it was pliable.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I thought maybe I'd found one she couldn't eat.  I didn't find that it flew amazingly well (though my throwing skills leave something to be desired, but the $1.00 store brand ones from the big box pet store fly really well) but the big problem was that she was able to chew a big chunk out of it within the first 24 hours of having it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I balked a bit at the price, but then remembered that the cheap frisbees I buy last anywhere from 30 seconds to a few days (or don't fly well).

Totally worth the money!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Frisbees are a hard plastic that ends up with sharp cuts all over.

My Doberman and I love this Jawz disc!  It's extremely tough (she hasn't been able to put a mark on it yet), and at the same time, a wonderfully soft surface for her mouth and my hands!  Flys great.  I was hesitant due to the price, but am so happy I bought this.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The best disc , bite proof and fly straight and true</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Finally a dog frisbee that flies. Most are too heavy or aerodynamically unstable.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Love this disc! It gets used daily and is stored outdoors and is holding up well. It flys well and is easy to toss because it has a nice rim. We’ve gone through dozens of other frisbees, some only lasting a week. I recommend this to all english shepherds and any other frisbee loving dogs.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was hesitant to buy a twenty something dollar frisbee since my dog goes through them like crazy. We normally use the red, floppy Kong frisbees and go through maybe 5 a year. My German Shepherd is a frisbee fanatic and is pretty rough on them, but she also drags them everywhere with her and is constantly mouthing on them. 
Back to the Hyperflite, it’s held up well over a month of extreme use, you can see where her teeth poke, but she hasn’t managed to put any holes in it yet. She also normally shreds the edges of her frisbees and I was worried that this one was going to get sharp, but we haven’t had any issues. The only thing I would change about this frisbee is that it isn’t as “hyperflexy</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have spent a lot of money buying frisbees that get destroyed on the first day and some that were too hard and hurt my dog's mouth or too floppy and fly like a brick. The Hyperflite is easy to toss on windy days as well as calm days and is soft enough as to not hurt my dog's mouth. I recently kept my daughter's 160 pound Rottweiler and he likes to play tug-of-war with the frisbee. After a week of the constant tugging, the frisbee was still in great shape (with a few teeth marks) and still flies great.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Hard durable plastic but flexible enough to fold in half.

He loves to play with it by himself just chewing on it, playing tug-a-war with other dogs or us, or parading it around like a trophy.
This toy has held up better than any other chew toy and it is soft so it doesn't hurt his teeth but still exercises his chaws and teeth.
We also like the bright color, which makes it easy to find when he takes it outside in the yard.

We would definitely buy it again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a 50 lb collie mix who destroys most toys in minutes. We've had this bone for 2+ years and it's still in good shape. He chews on it almost daily, and we play tug of war with him with it and it has held up well. It doesn't get rough edges like nylon based toys, so I don't worry about it hurting his mouth and we can grip it easily. This is literally the only toy that he hasn't destroyed. Please make more like it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog enjoyed a few treats and peanut butter crammed in both sides, immediately after he enjoyed the treat he started to split the ends so I took it away. Unfortunately one of the toddlers let him have it back and he's spent the last few weeks destroying it and ripping it into smaller pieces. Apparently I didn't pick up some fast enough and found them the other day after some rain in a pile in the yard. If you have a tough chewer I wouldn't get this toy, it won't last long.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this at a local retailer. I didn’t realize Chewy sold it. I’m so happy that they do. This toy is GREAT!! Both my 7 year old Samoyed Siberian Husky and my 9 month old Collie Pyrenees love IT!!

At first I was shocked to see my Husky interacting with it. He rarely ever plays. Then I got a little worried that he was going to chew through it. But this toy is true to its name, it’s definitely bionic. 

My collie who normally destroys his toys after 2 days, hasn’t been able to cause any damage to this :) 

Also I stuff both ends with treats  to keep them more engaged. But it would be nice if the depth of the toy  was longer so I could stuff more treats in it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog Riddick really loves this treat-toy!  He's been working on getting every little bit of treat crumb out of it, for a  long time now and not damaging the toy itself.... so far!   This is a good one!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy was advertised as being good for tough chewers.  It's even in the name. I bought two of them because my GSPs, one of whom is a puppy, love to chew. It took the puppy less than 10 minutes to chew through the ends of this toy.  Mercifully, it looks as though she spit out the tiny pieces: I was finding them everywhere.  I will never buy anything from this company again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My boy who destroys everything plays with this and has not been able to make a dent in it. He carries it around, plays tug and chews on it. It would get. 5 if it had a squeaker or made a crinkly noise, but without any noise, he loses interest in it quickly.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our pit mix loves this toy! It seems like it won't hold up forever to her chomping, so we only get it out to play fetch outside. She loves it - seemingly because it's heavy and fun to trot around with, and she clearly loves the chewy-rubbery texture too.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this toy for my daughters dog to pay with my dog when they come to visit. My problem has been I have a small 20 lb Frenchie and she has a 50 lb active dog. When they are together, its wild times and major tug of war. Normally the larger dog destroys every toy but NOT this one. Its a good size for each of them and the perfect durability and weight for both sizes. Holds up the best of all.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have hard chewers. They don’t like the hard plastic toys and usually rip through the ‘sturdy’ rubber ones.

It flies okay as a regular frisbee (perfectly fine for backyard play), but what it's really great for is longer distances like the park. If you throw it on its side (vertical) it rolls far and fast.

Though it doesn’t fly through the air as well as classic “frisbees” that I have used through the years it is still a wonderful toy. The way we play with it is this: I throw it, he retrieves it and then runs toward me, shoving the disc into my hand while gripping the other side in his mouth. His objective is a game of tug-a-war using the disc as the tug object — and how can I resist him? Of course, I cannot. So, for the next half hour, or so, we play tug-a-war with the sturdy, easy to grasp disc. The wide “chewy” rim is gentle on his mouth and it appears to be satisfying for him to bite and to chew on it.

It plays/throws/flys well and also when she chews it the frisbee doesn’t tear up &amp; neither does her face! The only down side, it’s a tad small.

He is usually considerably rough on his toys, most soft toys don't last long- usually only weeks. This may last months.

So far, it whistles, goes far enough in the area I have and satisfies what we need.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We were really excited about this toy, our GSD LOVES Chuck-It frisbees and Chuck-It balls. This frisbee was super heavy to throw and two of the whistles fell off the first day we took it to the park. Theo had a hard time picking it up and it hurt his face when he would try to catch it in the air like he does with his other frisbees.

The orange whistle pieces came out the first day and his teeth finished them off the 2nd day. They were fine with our smaller dog as she doesn't feel the need to bite on everything she plays with.
They are also a bit heavy so dont fly as well as the lighter weight ones.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs love this. It flies well and the whistles whistle.

Looking for a 3.5 LED nylon ball to chuck.  Something solid with option to replace battery when it dies.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">First time I used the chucker it was difficult to get the right throw.  Something changed from they way they were made originally.   Just can't get the right distance and I have used these length chuckers 100's of times.  The balls were different in that they were hard inside with a felt outside.  First time I ever saw that and after (1) use the ball cracked in half and I have a lab who DOES NOT chew the balls like some dogs do.  This was a first!  Very disappointing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This Chuckit is shorter than my other one - which is what i was looking for. It works okay compared to the other one- but its cup is angled in a way that overhand throwing puts the ball short, directly into the ground. To get a longer toss you have to throw low, from the side.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The reviews about the ball this comes with are correct, it was destroyed the first day. But the thrower itself is awesome! Our doodle loves to run FAR and brings the ball back every time. This thrower saves my husband’s shoulder and even I can throw the ball far with it. We upgraded to the whistler ball and he loves it! He chews on it before dropping it for the next run and it’s held up to it just fine, we’ve had it 3 months.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have multiple Chuckit ball tossers.  This one is bad!!   There is too much of a curve on the arm &amp; tosses the ball to the ground near you.  We also had to file down the top curve because it kept the ball too tight.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves to fetch and whenever he sees us pick this up, he gets so excited.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the tennis ball that comes with the launcher did not last long.  I would recommend ordering the rubber chuck it balls at the same time you order the chuck it launcher.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My girl loves to run and this is a great idea, but the ball that comes with it it terrible. It fell about after a few throws. I also bought the harder rubber ball. That has a great bounce. Unfortunately, it has such a great bounce that it bounced into the neighbors bushes and we have yet to find it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The Pro launcher does help throw balls farther, but it's too much. I have to launch as far as I can with the regular launcher for my dog, so I was hoping that the pro launcher would make it easier on my arm, but this launcher goes way too far. It's very durable and flexible and the handle is more comfortable than the regular launcher. It's way too long and a pain to carry around, even just from the car to the park. Also, it comes with a regular tennis ball, which is pretty much useless to our dog (it's destroyed in one day). You'd assume that a Pro launcher would come with something more durable, and Chewy mistakenly says that this comes with an Ultra ball in the product Q&amp;A, disappointing</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Perfect gadget for those with less than athletic throwing abilities.

To start with...I have a power chewer Doodle who absolutely loves the Chuckit Regular and amazingly doesn't destroy these smaller durable balls immediately. With the Pro Launcher, which I mistakenly thought would throw farther and be even more durable, had the large oversized tennis nall destroyed after our first outing.  Now have a launcher, no longer or more useful than the Regular Model, unable to accept the durable smaller Chuckit balls. I wouldn't bother with another set of large tennis balls-useless.

I think you should test your toys a little better at least if they're for a dog and if you really want to test them send them to me just send me free samples and I'll let you know how long they last with my dog I don't know how to tell you to make him tougher that's your job but I'd be more than happy to have my dog test them out for you just because I think nurses a good name and it's good for kids</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Of all the toys I bought for my Australian Labradoodle puppy, this one is the best.  It's her favorite as well...loves to retrieve and shake it hard.  It's holding up well under her sharp teeth. I'm not sure it can fly as far as they say, but it does go all the way across our living area and nothing gets damaged in the process. It would probably fly further out doors with the wind at its back. The first time I tried to make it fly, it went about 5 feet (lol), but with practice I'm getting perfect.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We use this in the pool as a fetch toy. It holds up to Abby and stays afloat!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Completely destroyed in 2 hours by my Australian Shepherd. Not for a chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy looks amazing at first then I started to use it and first of all the toy said it will launch 75 feet on the box, but that it not true at all maybe 10 feet on a good day. Also the knot at the end of the duck came totally unwound after the 3 pulls.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Purchased for 14 week old Aussie doodle puppy. NOT super durable. A few hours of play last night on Christmas and it’s toast! Chewed holes in it and stuffing coming out. Less than a half day of use. Tempted to send this crud back. DONT buy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Cacapoo loves this toy . I fling it into the bushes like a real bird and he goes crazy</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is well made and launches well with not too much effort which is important cause I’m not good at pitching. However, my lab is just not interested in it, he prefers a nice round ball which he will chase forever.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Unfortunately this ended up in the garbage after 10 minutes of play time due to poor stitching of the launching part after a few pulls the stitches started to pull out causing it to tear more and more each time. A real disappointment especially since she really liked it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Just bought this toy for my 45 lb German  Sheperd mix. It lasted less than 15 minutes. I love the Nerf dog toys, we have a ton of them . So for this to say its extra durable and for it to be destroyed so quickly I was very dissatisfied and disappointed ;(</span>]",launchers,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/nerf-dog-force-grip-trackshot/dp/175363

Awesome ball launcher does both!  Just the sight of this gun creates wagging tails and tapping paws. Shoots the balls farther than I can throw them and this is my replacement from another brand. The last one lasted over 2 years, this one is built more sturdy and gets used daily. Our Golden is not hyper crazy, but will chase balls as long as you shoot them. Creates great exercise in a fun way!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my 4 yr old golden's favorite toy. He's been playing with them for most of his life and insists that we go in the yard to shoot about 5 times a day. I sit, he drops the tennis ball in my lap and he's ready to rock! 10 minutes is usually enough to wear him out...that is until the next time.
This is great for weight control and muscle development! Of course it has to be replaced from time to time so we always keep a backup gun in the garage.
PLEASE DON'T EVER DISCONTINUE THIS TOY!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I'm purchasing a new one today as finally wore the other one out.  If you want to truly get distance, I recommend buying good pressurized tennis balls. They shoot farter and also bounce better.  My dog loves to look over her shoulder when running to get it on the fly or at least on the first bounce.  Fun to watch her leap for it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My boyfriend got this for our dog for Christmas and it just broke last week. We use it constantly!! My dog loves playing fetch but always gets the ball all slobbery so this no-touch cannon is AWESOME! We just got a new one in the mail. My dog recognized it as soon as I pulled it out of the box!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my third different tennis ball launcher and so far, the best!  The other two brands broke within 2 months. It is made very well, easy for me with arthritis to pull the handle back.  It shoots a standard tennis ball farther than the other launchers I’ve had.  My lab heads right for the K9 Kannon launcher every time I let her outside.  It is her ultimate favorite toy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a runner and loves to play fetch. I bought this product based on the description saying it could launch a ball up to 75 ft.   I haven’t been able to reach 20ft, if I’ve reached that. Very disappointed with this purchase.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Just got this ball launcher today, ( 7/8/2020 ) Tried it out and It only launches the ball around 10 feet. Also came with only 1 ball. Tried to look up my order and I’m guessing that Chewy doesn’t carry this ball launcher anymore. And I just ordered this on July 2, 2020.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Beaux Bella, our Black Lab, is really lackadaisical if a ball is simply thrown, especially by Mom who throws like girl.  When she hears the ratcheting sound of an impending launch from the K9 Kannon she gets sooooooo happy her behind nearly wags off.

However, we do need to keep it out of sight, to the point of using different hiding places to confuse her or she will either get so excited we have to get it &amp; play, or if it's within her reach she will bring it to us 

The only downside to the K9 Kannon is not being able to replace the large rubber band. It lasts quite awhile, but eventually it does need to be replaced and your only recourse is to replace the toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We love the K9 Kannon!  We have a 2 year old German Shepherd and when it's not raining we play fetch 3-4 times a day.  I can sit on our swing and shoot the Kannon as long as he wants to chase it.  I have tried several other devices and this has been the best by far.  Only issue is the rubber band inside is not available to purchase.  As often as we play, sometimes it wares out about 6 months.  It usually still works but doesn't shoot nearly as far.  Keep indoors when not in use as extreme heat or cold will shorten its life.  New/dry balls also shoot farther.  I keep 3 balls loaded in the gun just for fetch.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the second one we have purchased. We used to have to stop throwing the ball because our arms hurt. No more. Now we can go until the dogs are tired, and, we do not have to touch the ball. Recommend highly. Just wish we could purchase the rubber bands separately.</span>]",launchers,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/hyper-pet-k9-kannon-k2-tennis-ball/dp/167049

Harsh recoil from a metal spring instead of silicone band and balls do not have the same velocity as Hyperpet.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">So, I bought this before I saw the bad reviews. I figured oh well whats the harm i already paid. 
Just a disclaimer too, we have two of the nerf brand ball shooters as well.
       For anyone looking for a ball shooter, I recommend the nerf gun brand in blue and orange. Those I got on sale a few yrs ago and it's truly worth it. I decided on a new one because we left our nerf ones outside in the rain amd sun and it doesnt shoot as smoothly now, but still way better than this product. 

I'm angry at this ball shooter, but the plastic is cheap, you can tell when you open it. The handle you pull back is cheaply made, I dont expect it to last long.

Then it is so easy to throw and goes sooo far. Such a great alternative to tennis balls. And you can rinse it off. If you press on the inner portion of the ring with the launcher it tilts slightly and is easy to pick up hands free. Learn to use it and your pup will be eternally grateful.

I purchased a mini ball launcher similar to this one and it lasted almost two years! Then once the rubber band finally broke, I bought a new full sized canon. We were excited to play with the new toy, but after not even a few hours, the trigger snapped and the fun was over. I just purchased two new mini launcher believing the the full sized canon was too strong for its own good, but yet again, after only a few hours of play the mini canon broke. Seems that these toys must now be poorly made and no longer worth purchasing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The first day my little shih tzu was scared of this because it makes quite a noise when pulling back the plunger to load the ball and a loud click when the trigger is pulled.  She would run after the ball after I faked a throw but was afraid to bring it back.  I was disappointed but didn't give up as this thing is an arm saver and fun to shoot. By day 2 she had grasped the concept and accepted the noise as friendly and we now enjoy a fun play day. It will shoot smaller balls also but you have to hold the end up so the ball doesn't roll out. Also the newer the ball the further it will shoot.  Its like playing tennis,  older balls are less bouncy. I highly recommend this toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I go crazy when my mom gets out the bag with the gun in it. I love to dig in the snow to find the ball. In fact I sometimes bury it again. I look beautiful with tiny snowball on my face.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our Lola Mae absolutely loves this! We have to limit her to 15 minutes each time we play or she wears herself out. She knows where we keep it, when we go by the door she goes buzerk she wants to play so bad! She loves to play ball anyway so this gives us human’s a rest on our arm from throwing the ball!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 6mth old puppy loves this toy. She hears the clicks and knows the ball is about to come out. It doesn't matter that the ball doesn't go all that far because she is a 20lb pup. Also, the mini balls fit in her mouth and are easy for her to carry. 
It has been a great way to help her burn off energy and the excitement is contagious (I love to take her out and ""shoot the balls""). 
(Her brother is 80lbs and has the larger gun with larger balls and she doesn't like the large balls - oh,and we're not quite as please with the larger gun which doesn't shoot the balls very far at all). 
I recommend this gun highly. Don't leave it outside (in the cold) cocked,though, because the rubber band gets loose</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">disappointed.

He loves to play catch and throwing the ball all the time makes the arm tired. And the ball ends up getting slimy too. This toy takes care of both of the problems at once.

Still working on him dropping the ball into the launcher on his own, but we are training in increments:  bring the ball to the launcher, nudge the ball out of my hand into the launcher, and [hopefully soon] dropping it in himself.
He understands that this device will throw the balls for him, and he keeps trying to bark at it or stick his nose in the holes.

The price was great too</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have had so much fun using this with my 5 month old golden retriever puppy! He is, of course, a ball of energy. He has a hard time fetching larger, heavier balls just yet, and will often lose interest after a few throws because of that. These balls are the perfect solution since they're much lighter weight and have the openings to help him carry them back! Also love that the balls aren't fabric like tennis balls so they're easy to rinse off if they get muddy. The ""zip"" sound really keeps him excited and engaged, too. One of the best toys I've ever bought!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It doesn’t go as far as the chuck it we love, but the fun zip sound it makes is cool!

For the price, though, cant be beat!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves this toy. She loves the zip sound and she loves to chase the balls. It’s even better since multiple balls can be thrown each time. She enjoys the tennis ball launcher on occasion, but she is engaged with this toy almost every time I take it out. The balls are lightweight and easy for her to hold in her mouth and squish a bit, which she seems to enjoy. They have stood up to a Labrador Retriever’s chewing for a few weeks so far!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pups don't always like the same toys, but they both love this one!
My oldest is especially hard to please and this is now one of his favorites!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Ok, we currently have another launcher and must say for the price this is a great toy!

These are the only types of balls that he fetches. The balls are light and open compared to other balls.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My ball fetching grandpuppy could not be happier and neither could I. No more picking up and throwing slobbery balls. And this sucker flings these special balls pretty far which helps wear his puppy energy out.

I was very excited to get this toy for my ADD husband, who gets bored throwing the ball to the dog. He loved it and was testing it out in the house, lol! One of our dogs doesn't like the noise it makes, and is not a huge fan, but it's perfect for our hyper active pitt-mix! Our arms don't get tired, but he does chasing the ball all day. I do wish it came with an extra ball (if you lose that one that comes with it, smaller, standard tennis balls do fit, but not as well).</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Australian Shepherd Approved. Nuff said? We've used this thing way more than a year, and more times a day than I would try to count. I've shot this blaster so many times a day for so many months I have tennis elbow so...watch out. Change up the hand with which you pull the trigger. I didn't. Didn't even realize I was going south til I woke up one day South!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I like Nerf products but not for dogs. Well, at least not for my pooch who has a serious bite. Balls lasted maybe 15 minutes before they were shredded. Also, launcher does not launch as advertised. Better off spending the money on a good sturdy ball and toss it around the old fashion way.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 6 year old couldn’t get the ball out so he tried to pull it out... his hand was super stuck. The screws don’t open it completely and my husband had to cut it apart. 

Why wouldn’t you be able to take it apart?! It was a wonderful way to be woken up this am.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog Ramon is obsessed with this gun!  His first one lasted about  7 months with using it easily 100 times a DAY!   The only reason we bought a second was the rubber band snapped from over use!  We’ve also gifted it to a few ball loving pups!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is so much fun for the dogs. They LOVED it and now that it broke (only a few months after getting it) fetch just isn't the same. I haven't taken it apart to figure it out but it seems like the spring or band inside that launches the ball snapped in half.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs LOVE this toy! I just wish it would shoot the ball farther. Also the chunk it balls fit! Which is great if your dogs are hard on balls! Tennis balls rarely last more than a day.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this for my husband as something fun to try with our ball centric dogs. He used it for exactly 5 throws and the trigger stopped working. Chewy customer service was great. Full refund and best of all they didn’t make me send it back. I can throw it away.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 3yr old Shepherd mix loves this ball shooter!! Literally can’t contain his excitement even when you just pick it up.  Great way to get them to learn fetch play.  My only concern is that I have purchased 4 of them over 3 years because they broke from so much use.  However for the price I will keep buying it because I have a very sad dog when it breaks and he waits for the new one to be delivered! Lol</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the best toy ever!  Our German Shepherd puppy, Panzer, is a 7 month old 70 lb fireball.  He has always loved retrieving tennis balls so when I saw this blaster I had to get it.  I read the reviews and some are negative regarding the noise and operation of the blaster.  I only have positive things to say - it is not loud, it is so easy to use, and it is saving my arm from throwing the ball over and over.  Panzer immediately figured out the trajectory of the ball and looks out into the yard expectantly - sometimes catching it in midair.  My husband thinks I like the blaster more than Panzer (I do!).  I HIGHLY recommend this blaster.  We use it several times a day, it is easy to use, it </span>]",sticks,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/nerf-dog-tennis-ball-blaster-dog-toy/dp/175366

Looking for a 3.5 LED nylon ball to chuck.

Something changed from they way they were made originally.   Just can't get the right distance and I have used these length chuckers 100's of times.  The balls were different in that they were hard inside with a felt outside.

I have to launch as far as I can with the regular launcher for my dog, so I was hoping that the pro launcher would make it easier on my arm, but this launcher goes way too far. It's very durable and flexible and the handle is more comfortable than the regular launcher. It's way too long and a pain to carry around, even just from the car to the park. Also, it comes with a regular tennis ball, which is pretty much useless to our dog (it's destroyed in one day).

I'm on my 2nd (the last was a gift as I wouldn't have gotten another). True to timing with the first, after about 9 mos of using it ~3 times a week for an hour, the motor just dies. This is a really, really expensive toy to die so quickly.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is fun toy no doubt. The down fall and at $65+ for the actual dispenser, I haven't been able to find balls that are compatible for the smaller unit. The replacement balls are $11-$12 for a sleeve of 4 mini balls. That's way out of line for tennis balls. I found that my Boston Terrier is biting down on the balls and cracking them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have 2 Cavaliers both about 18 months they love the Ifetch so much!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is an awesome toy, however the popping sound startles my dog so he will not get close enough to drop the balls back in. It is probably best for a large dog. There was a different style available that I think would probably be much better for small dogs. He does love chasing the balls so I will definitely continue to encourage him to use it by himself.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This dog has a lot of energy and loves playing with toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was checking on this automatic ball launcher dog toy, and on the original website from the manufacturer if the enclosed balls are not working; use a squash ball the same size, and it works much better. The manufacturer said that any ball the same size would work. I want to purchase one for my little dog, and am leary because of the reviews for the ball not being able to launch and getting stuck, but was wondering if anyone has tried the squash ball?</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The device is very well built and the concept is great. However, the balls become fuzzy within the first minutes of use and within a few dozen throws, the balls stick and won’t go through the machine. The ball fuzz will eventually become wrapped around the mechanism causing it to cease functionality. 

I’ve purchased both the iFetch and iDig. Both were unable to be used within 30-45 days. It really feels like a company that manufactures products and sell them without running it through any real-world testing.</span>]",sticks,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/ifetch-mini-automatic-ball-launcher/dp/142434

If you want to truly get distance, I recommend buying good pressurized tennis balls. They shoot farter and also bounce better.

Fun to watch her leap for it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My boyfriend got this for our dog for Christmas and it just broke last week. We use it constantly!!

My dog recognized it as soon as I pulled it out of the box!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is my third different tennis ball launcher and so far, the best!  The other two brands broke within 2 months. It is made very well, easy for me with arthritis to pull the handle back.  It shoots a standard tennis ball farther than the other launchers I’ve had.  My lab heads right for the K9 Kannon launcher every time I let her outside.  It is her ultimate favorite toy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a runner and loves to play fetch. I bought this product based on the description saying it could launch a ball up to 75 ft.   I haven’t been able to reach 20ft, if I’ve reached that. Very disappointed with this purchase.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Just got this ball launcher today, ( 7/8/2020 ) Tried it out and It only launches the ball around 10 feet. Also came with only 1 ball. Tried to look up my order and I’m guessing that Chewy doesn’t carry this ball launcher anymore. And I just ordered this on July 2, 2020.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Beaux Bella, our Black Lab, is really lackadaisical if a ball is simply thrown, especially by Mom who throws like girl.  When she hears the ratcheting sound of an impending launch from the K9 Kannon she gets sooooooo happy her behind nearly wags off.

However, we do need to keep it out of sight, to the point of using different hiding places to confuse her or she will either get so excited we have to get it &amp; play, or if it's within her reach she will bring it to us 

The only downside to the K9 Kannon is not being able to replace the large rubber band. It lasts quite awhile, but eventually it does need to be replaced and your only recourse is to replace the toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We love the K9 Kannon!  We have a 2 year old German Shepherd and when it's not raining we play fetch 3-4 times a day.  I can sit on our swing and shoot the Kannon as long as he wants to chase it.  I have tried several other devices and this has been the best by far.  Only issue is the rubber band inside is not available to purchase.  As often as we play, sometimes it wares out about 6 months.  It usually still works but doesn't shoot nearly as far.  Keep indoors when not in use as extreme heat or cold will shorten its life.  New/dry balls also shoot farther.  I keep 3 balls loaded in the gun just for fetch.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the second one we have purchased. We used to have to stop throwing the ball because our arms hurt. No more. Now we can go until the dogs are tired, and, we do not have to touch the ball. Recommend highly. Just wish we could purchase the rubber bands separately.</span>]",sticks,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/hyper-pet-k9-kannon-k2-tennis-ball/dp/167049

By day 2 she had grasped the concept and accepted the noise as friendly and we now enjoy a fun play day. It will shoot smaller balls also but you have to hold the end up so the ball doesn't roll out. Also the newer the ball the further it will shoot.  Its like playing tennis,  older balls are less bouncy. I highly recommend this toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I go crazy when my mom gets out the bag with the gun in it. I love to dig in the snow to find the ball. In fact I sometimes bury it again. I look beautiful with tiny snowball on my face.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our Lola Mae absolutely loves this! We have to limit her to 15 minutes each time we play or she wears herself out. She knows where we keep it, when we go by the door she goes buzerk she wants to play so bad!

She hears the clicks and knows the ball is about to come out. It doesn't matter that the ball doesn't go all that far because she is a 20lb pup. Also, the mini balls fit in her mouth and are easy for her to carry. 
It has been a great way to help her burn off energy and the excitement is contagious (I love to take her out and ""shoot the balls""). 
(Her brother is 80lbs and has the larger gun with larger balls and she doesn't like the large balls - oh,and we're not quite as please with the larger gun which doesn't shoot the balls very far at all). 
I recommend this gun highly. Don't leave it outside (in the cold) cocked,though, because the rubber band gets loose</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">disappointed.

If he were left to his own devices with this toy, it wouldnt have lasted 5 minutes out of the box. Overall, it's fun but I wouldnt purchase again because he is a chewer and it's just not strong enough for that.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The item I received was covered in dirt when it arrived which actually discolored the item permanently. Seems like maybe it was a return that someone tossed out in the yard and decided they didn’t like. 

I haven’t actually tried it yet because it’s not something I could just give to my pup to play with. She would destroy it in minutes. 

I shoulda returned it but had already ripped off the packaging before I realized it was discolored.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have one puppy; she is a chewer for sure. That's why I was excited when this said it was tear and puncture resistant. NOT! My puppy broke it into pieces within 8 minutes. Had to basically throw it all out so she wouldn't eat the plastic pieces. Extremely disappointed. It's so hard to find durable toys for her but at least don't claim to be if you aren't!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 75lb lab likes this toy for fetch.  We took it to the beach for her to retrieve and she brought it back but did not seem enthused.....it has a hole in the top of and back of head and I am fairly certain she took in a mouthful of salt water while retrieving it.  So this is a no for the beach but would be great for a pool or lake!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Can't chew it up, can't break it. It tugs (if it is allowed in your house); you can shake it, throw it, toss it. But best of all when the dog tosses it into your TV screen, it softly bounces off with no damage done. I love this toy, have bought many of them so there is always one nearby.</span>]",sticks,interactive toys,https://www.chewy.com/ruff-dawg-cat-pult-launching-dog-toy/dp/136095
