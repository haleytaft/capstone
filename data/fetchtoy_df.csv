We take him to the hockey rink at the park around the corner from us and have him fetch after it and bring it back. It had a great bounce.

My 7 and a half month old pitbull puppy had this for literally 12 minutes and she chewed a piece off!

It flies very well, is easy to clean, and is very durable. It's great as an athletic toy and as a chew toy. It even survived some tug-of-war roughhousing, there's not a scratch on it! The toy is floppy, so it's easy to pack and carry. We have these in both sizes and will definitely re-purchase should we ever need a replacement (Actually, we already have, as we lost one in a river. Read: these do not float- their only downside)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 55#, 9-month old mutt puppy is a destructoid. Pillows? He ate em. Frisbees? Chomped in one bite. Anything left lying around is puppy chow. I knew we needed to invest for the long haul and got this kong frisbee and it's become one of his favorite toys. He has a great time playing with it all by himself - it's quite floppy and the way it moves is enough to engage him for a good while and he can safely tug and chew without fear of it cracking or tearing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This frisbee shaped chunk of rubber does not have any of the aerodynamic properties of a real frisbee. When I cast it the Kong Flyer just travels ballistically and plops on the ground like a rock. My dog likes to grab it and run around as the rubber is soft. Other than that the purchase of the Kong Flyer was a waste of money...</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have purchased many Kong Frisbees for our German Shepherd. It is her favorite toy! They are very durable and last much longer than other brands. They make a smaller version for small pups too.
The Chewy price is lower than other pet stores!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our collie couldn't love a toy  more than this. She prances across the field with this in her mouth--tail held high. She struts  in triumph. Her absolute favorite fetch toy. We already have one--we just bought a second to be covered whenever this old one dies---which seems really unlikely as they are more durable than imaginable. Nothing fazes this thing! It's soft so her teeth are protected but she can chew and gnaw at it incessantly without making a dent in it. And the red color keeps it from getting lost in the grass. Thanks Kong!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is simply too heavy to fly like a Frisbee. Very flimsy which is good when my GSD gets ahold of it. It doesn't float through the air, however. It's pretty heavy and, combined with how flimsy it is, doesn't fly very well. He still loves it but I don't enjoy throwing it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The Kong Classic Flyer Frisbee toy does not float like a true frisbee and therefore is next to impossible for the dog to catch in the air. They have just as much chance to catch a ball so there isn’t much to gain by being a disk.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This frisbee is the love of our 3 year old pitties life! He carries it around and always keeps it close (even when sleeping). It holds up much better than other frisbees we’ve tried, and this guy is a CHEWER! We have to replace it about every 4 weeks, but it sees A LOT of action every single day.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It’s great for chewing but doesn’t fly. My dogs don’t enjoy it like I hoped.  As I have always liked the good quality of King products I bought two in hopes of having something durable for them to chase.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our mixed breed dog is a destructive chewer. She loves getting new toys but they usually don't last through the day. We bought 2 of these frisbees so we could get her to release the one she brings back. They aren't even showing teeth marks. It's her favorite play time and they fly good enough to catch in the air. I would recommend this toy.</span>]",discs,fetch toys

So, I always fly squirrel first &amp; he happily takes off and then I roll her frisbee.  Both bring them back to me and we do it again &amp; again &amp; again!  Perfect toy for a strong, busy boy. He loves it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is by far my 4 month old puppy's favorite toy!!  She loves to play catch with it, and loves to sling it around.  My only complaint is that the stitching on the underside is coming loose but it still flies fine!  I'm sure I will have to replace it in the next few months but she absolutely loves it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My human wanted something he could play with.  I love how I have him trained to 'retrieve' my toy,  I have to make uer that he gets HIS exercise since he needs to deliver my meals to me.  I want him to be around a long time.  Since I am not a ball player, the flying squirrel is ideal for me.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Besides using our squirrel for retrieving fun,  we use it to manage our dog's over-excitement when folks come to visit.   Our flying squirrel is high-value &amp; our young, rescue dog sits and engages when we present the toy.  Love it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was not sure at first if Atticus would catch on to this, but he is learning and absolutely loves it.  As soon as he sees me pick it up he is very alert and ready to go outside.  While I cannot throw a frisbe very well, this was pretty easy for me to learn to throw and he brings it right back for more.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My baby girl loves, loves, loves this frisbee! It's her favorite outdoor toy. It has lasted for years. I am ordering a second one because we misplaced the first one.

I've been through 4-5 of these over the years and just ordered two more that came in today.

I highly recommend these, they're pretty awesome.  They will fly very far and if your dog likes frisbees, they will definitely enjoy the flying squirrel.  It's easier to control throwing it in my opinion than a regular frisbee and for a larger dog, it's much more durable.  It's the best $8 toy for my dog for sure.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog Bambi loves her Flying Squirrel toy. In fact I just bought her a new one because the old one is getting worn out!
It is super strong (tug of war is her favorite game) and the fabric really holds up. We leave it outside all the time and it has held up well.
Would recommend it to a friend definitely.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is obsessed with this toy.  My last dog was too but I feel like the quality has gone down over the  years.  I've had to reinforce the stitching on the last 3 I've gotten and they STILL get torn apart in about 3 weeks.  This is no fault of Chewys, I just wish Chuckit would make a sturdier Flying Squirrel Frisbee.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this for my German Shepherd Dog for her one year old birthday.

It's light, floats really nicely, and is soft on the mouth. We starting using it when she was small (15lbs and she will reach approx. 80lbs) and it was easy for her to carry back.

She likes that it’s soft to chew, light to carry and bright colors to help her find it on the grass (especially because dogs can see blue).

They are intentionally looking to destroy the toy and are not content to just nom on it in ""normal"" play.

If you've got a tough chewer, I would say that this would be a great purchase for you. 
It'd be cool to be able to choose the colors. For some reason, my dogs do prefer certain colored toys to others, I'm not sure why. Like I said, I buy multiples of the same toy and they usually prefer the red-based toys (vs greens). Luckily, we got a red one when we purchased. 
I'd recommend this for certain. :)</span>]",discs,fetch toys

I LOVE my floppy frisbee!
I’m not sure why people think this is a chew toy.

Most toys last minutes, so far the best have lasted a few weeks. The thick Kong balls have held up well. We had bought her a red Kong frisbee that was great. She destroyed it, but it took about three weeks to become fully compromised. I bought the black “extreme” Kong frisbee hoping it would be a step up in longevity. It was somehow far thinner and flimsier than the supposedly less indestructible red version. It lasted about 45 seconds before she tore the entire outside off it in one long strip. Unimpressed to say the least.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dog loves frisbee and had 2 of the red kong flyers that she never damaged.

We are very disappointed for the price point.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I've purchased many of these Kong Frisbee's over the years and my dogs love them!

So I ordered the extreme, thinking it could take a little more abuse. The original still flies after over a month, just a little beat up. The extreme he destroyed in about a week or so. The extreme is the tougher rubber, but so thin - teeth went easily thru and first tear was during first use. Because it is lighter, it flies a little better, so its great from that perspective.

We just received our replacements today and darn it, it seems they have downgraded their material again.  One catch...and teeth punctures. These won't last a NY minute.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My owner bought several of these from different companies.  All of  them are warped and out of round. What a waste. My owner bought one last year and it was fine. What happened in the manufacturing process. Not Chewy's fault but it is the supplier. Don't waste your owners money on this thing.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We thought we had found our favorite frisbee! The first one lasted about 3 months. Then we bought a new one to replace it. It lasted 2 days before falling apart on one of the stiches. Our dog didnt even chew it up, it just came apart.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Unfortunately it seems to be be manufactured wrong,as though the fabric was too small, and has a slight oval shape instead of round so it just dives into the ground to the side when thrown. A large size purchased at the same time seems to fly fine so hopefully it was just one disc that is bad. I've been buying these for years from a different manufacturer who stopped making them and never had a problem so I'm a little worried.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Was trying to replace a great tough canvas disc that had lasted a couple of years.

This toy is his absolute favorite, even when it's thrown by an uncoordinated old woman (me).  Throw it overhand, vertically - NOT like a flying disk.  After a good throw, my dog gives the toy a ""squeak of approval"" as he runs it back to me.  When we're done with our walk, the toy goes back on the shelf so it doesn't become a chew toy.

Not easily lost, not a choking hazard, works great!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is about 20lbs and loves to shake the frisbee when she catches it.

Anyways, not even an hour into playing with it, she killed the squeaker and put a hole in the bottom of the ball. The top of the ball is made of more durable plastic, but the bottom (i am guessing because of the squeaker) is not very durable. If you have a dog that gets obsessed with chewing toys, don’t even waste your time or money on this one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I left this with my dog unsupervised for five minutes and she tore the entire outer portion off.

How do you throw it? Tossing like a frisbee doesn't work well. I will toss it perpendicular as opposed to horizontal (like a frisbee). Perpendicular seems to work as it will roll when it hits the ground and is easy for them to grab. The squeaker is fun but they have a hard time squeaking it. The disk part gets in the way of them grabbing the ball part. It really only squeaks when it hits the ground. I usually put their outdoor toys up after we've played with them. I left these ones out because I didn't care if they got destroyed. They have NOT got destroyed.  Dogs love them. We play with them ALL the dang time. Ugh.

My border collie/Kelpie mix hates it. Firstly, it flys like garbage. It doesn't stay flat and is so thick that my dog has a hard time catching it.
Secondly, you can't fly it long. My dog is really fast and usually goes out 25-30 yards, but you can't fly this thing more than ten, and if you do, it Will not stay flat. It also flys very slow and is cumbersome to handle. Maybe it would be Ok if you had a quarter acre yard, but otherwise it's worthless.
The only good thing about it is that it is a fairly good material. That being said, if your dog is really good at catching frisbee, stay away from this one, buy something else </span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We've tried every configuration of frisbee offered for our Border Collies.

Our 50lb Husky/Heeler isn't the best at catching, and the lightweight-ness and material this is made of gives him plenty of time to run and chase and attempt a catch.

Neither my husband or I can make it fly properly and my aussie cannot catch it well because it's so thick.  He can catch pretty much anything, so that surprised us.  I suppose if you needed a frisbee that floats or your dog just likes to carry something around, it might be worthwhile, but my dude wants to catch a frisbee in the air and then bring it directly back for another go.

It is soft enough for ease in repeated catching, yet durable enough that my male GSD won't easily shred it with supervised play.

Being floppy and also a bit heavy it just doesn't fly well for the more serious players.

Pros; decent weight (240ish grams if i remember correctly), glows good I'll normally put it in front of my headlights for about 20 seconds and it'll last about 15 or so minutes, flies decent.
Cons; the lip on it makes it kinda odd to grip (i play alot of dg though so I'm picky obout how my grip is), not the best in a head wind, doesn't feel like the most durable plastic.

Definitely would suggest it if you got a pup that you have to run multiple times a day.

Our dog loves playing tug.  Smaller toys are difficult to hold onto, even worse when they get slimy.  It's mostly rubber so it will hold up well. This toy is great because it's easy to hold onto while she pulls &amp; shakes to get it away from me.  I put it in her toy basket at night &amp; she pulls it out in the morning, starting each day with tug-o-war. My husband loves it for no squeaker.  A new favorite all the way around!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is sure a poor excuse for a tug toy because my puppy had pierced the rubber and ripped the stitching off of one of the handles within only a few minutes of play. Since this toy is stuffed i’m unable to continue using it because my puppy will just fixate on the white stuffing coming out of it. Really disappointing</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I'm giving a 2 star because the description did say ""This toy is not recommended for heavy chewers. No toy is indestructible."" However, I truly expected it to last longer than FOUR MINUTES. Incredibly disappointed in the quality. :( It seems the stitching could be improved which would make this a great toy. The rubber parts are durable and are holding her attention but that stitching shouldn't come apart so easily. I'm not sure what dog this would be good for. It's too bulky for small dogs, not tough enough for active medium dogs and obviously not good for large breeds.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was nervous to order this toy after a string of destroyed toys, but it’s been great! The lack of a squeaker has made it not interesting to our bulldog who obsessed over squeakers and doesn’t stop until they are out and neutralized. Our 75 lb golden has enjoyed it for weeks now. It’s shaped perfectly for tug of war, and for fetching. The rubberized surface it perfect for chewing. None of the seams have been chewed up yet, it is holding up great.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">If you have a ""chewer"", then this toy is good only for tug play with you and your dog. Do not leave your dog alone with it, or it will be destroyed within 5 minutes.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">One of my dogs is a large pup, so he's an aggressive chewer. This toy made it through 3 weeks before getting ruined. If your dog isn't a chewer this toy would probably last for years. It's large and has a handle on each side so it's great for two dogs to play with it simultaneously.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a hard chewer. Don't expect toys to last long but this was a record. Took it away because he was eating rubber pieces.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These toys are really tough and can take a lot of abuse from my crew!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I love this toy, I have bought two of them, and another one in another color. My pup loves them. For the price, I couldn't resist buying more than one! So durable, strong and who doesn't love tug a war toys?!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Although this toy is durable, it is not a fun toy. The hand/mouth openings are too narrow for hands or mouth. My 40 lbs hound mix has trouble grabbing it, and the hard rubber like material makes it very uncomfortable. It is so heavy, your dog will get a good hard thump if they ever got hit with it. My dog's favorite game is tug, but not with this. I gave it some points for durability. I'm sure the half-life is 10,000 years.</span>]",discs,fetch toys

This toy has held up better than any other chew toy and it is soft so it doesn't hurt his teeth but still exercises his chaws and teeth.
We also like the bright color, which makes it easy to find when he takes it outside in the yard.

It doesn't get rough edges like nylon based toys, so I don't worry about it hurting his mouth and we can grip it easily. This is literally the only toy that he hasn't destroyed. Please make more like it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog enjoyed a few treats and peanut butter crammed in both sides, immediately after he enjoyed the treat he started to split the ends so I took it away. Unfortunately one of the toddlers let him have it back and he's spent the last few weeks destroying it and ripping it into smaller pieces. Apparently I didn't pick up some fast enough and found them the other day after some rain in a pile in the yard. If you have a tough chewer I wouldn't get this toy, it won't last long.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this at a local retailer. I didn’t realize Chewy sold it. I’m so happy that they do. This toy is GREAT!! Both my 7 year old Samoyed Siberian Husky and my 9 month old Collie Pyrenees love IT!!

At first I was shocked to see my Husky interacting with it. He rarely ever plays. Then I got a little worried that he was going to chew through it. But this toy is true to its name, it’s definitely bionic. 

My collie who normally destroys his toys after 2 days, hasn’t been able to cause any damage to this :) 

Also I stuff both ends with treats  to keep them more engaged. But it would be nice if the depth of the toy  was longer so I could stuff more treats in it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog Riddick really loves this treat-toy!  He's been working on getting every little bit of treat crumb out of it, for a  long time now and not damaging the toy itself.... so far!   This is a good one!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy was advertised as being good for tough chewers.  It's even in the name. I bought two of them because my GSPs, one of whom is a puppy, love to chew. It took the puppy less than 10 minutes to chew through the ends of this toy.  Mercifully, it looks as though she spit out the tiny pieces: I was finding them everywhere.  I will never buy anything from this company again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My boy who destroys everything plays with this and has not been able to make a dent in it. He carries it around, plays tug and chews on it. It would get. 5 if it had a squeaker or made a crinkly noise, but without any noise, he loses interest in it quickly.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our pit mix loves this toy! It seems like it won't hold up forever to her chomping, so we only get it out to play fetch outside. She loves it - seemingly because it's heavy and fun to trot around with, and she clearly loves the chewy-rubbery texture too.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this toy for my daughters dog to pay with my dog when they come to visit. My problem has been I have a small 20 lb Frenchie and she has a 50 lb active dog. When they are together, its wild times and major tug of war.

We didn’t know how he would take to hooves, but SURPRISE this is a winner. Yes it does smell, all hooves do. Caution to those buying for the rope itself: our little guy destroyed the rope within five minutes. It’s still hanging on by one of the colored segments, but it’s basically a gnarly mess (which he actually prefers, go figure). When he finally breaks the hooves free of the rope, we’ll have an upstairs hoof and a downstairs hoof so we don’t have to keep carrying the toy around!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Sully was anxious to play with his new toy, as he has enjoyed hoof toys at the sitter’s. The package arrived five minutes ago. He has already cracked the first hoof and is on the second. They are more like shells of hooves-very thin. He doesn’t have a hard bite-he is a golden with a gentle mouth who plays pretty nice. Always hate leaving a poor review but this one is definitely not for us. The rope is also fairly thin.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 65lb Aussie Shep/Terrier, he made pretty quick work of this as he is a heavy chewer which was my fault. He liked the hooves and continues to play with the rope with my toddler. I would consider buying again except for the smell! It’s smells awful, way worse than any bully stick I’ve ever smelled and I was not prepared for it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Puppies loved the taste but we have large breed puppies that are aggressive chewers.  They broke off the hooves and pieces are extremely sharp.  I threw them away.  It was very salty and didn’t like that puppies drank gallons of water for a long time afterwards.  They are still playing with the rope though.  It is very durable.  I wouldn’t leave this toy unsupervised.  Maybe chew for awhile, and take away.  They will need lots of water but love the taste.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I did not read the description where they warn against giving the toy to heavy chewers.

I have two German Shepherds, visiting royalty...and my own collie, Lance Lardbutt.  I gave each  one of these chew toys and they played and chewed to their hearts content.   One of the Shepherds, the girl, is still a puppy and chews voraciously since she is still teething, so they didn't last long at all....at least the bone parts didn't.  These are not for  larger and more chew-oriented dogs.  The hooves got chewed off fairly easily and rapidly, especially with the one dogette... since she is in  ""chew everything"" mode.  They still play with the ropes and I have utilized them to</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 7 month old pup loved the toy, so much that she chewed the hooves off within a day and proceeded to eat chunks of them before I could find all of the pieces and pick them up.

Most of the puppy toys have disintegrated and been torn apart within minutes by our puppy. He absolutely loves this toy. It’s durable, can be tossed around, he loves to chew on the “bones” and it keeps him occupied for hours. The rope portions is great for playing tug of war with him. Extremely satisfied with our purchase.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 35-40 lb lab mix likes this toy - she is always interested when I pull it out of the toy box, but it's a little too big for her. She can't get her mouth around the bones and it's too heavy for her to drag around. But we're keeping it in rotation in the hopes that she'll gnaw on it later.

But for some reason, she prefers to chew the rope rather than the bone LOL. After 2 days, the rope has taken a beating, but it's still in tack. The rope itself will probably only last a month, but the bones are rock solid. One major thing Ive noticed is if the pup starts to shake their heads while having the rope in their mouth, be careful of them knocking themselves in the head with the bones.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The quality of the rope was thin and flimsy. The knots were not large enough to keep the bones on. Our dog got the bones off within 30 minutes. We had a dog who got their lower jaw stuck in a bone like this, so it was a disappointment that the bones came loose right away. We have bought better rope/bone combo toys before.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this toy based on the high reviews.  What a disappointment.  Within days of introducing this new toy to my 2 boxers....it has been thrown away.  The rope tore off in pieces(all over the house) and ultimately ripped into 3 different sections.  The bones even fell apart and we cause little pieces to get stuck in my dogs throat.  If you have larger dogs who want to play with something, avoid this toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is pretty picky about dog toys, and loves to chew... but hasn't liked antlers. However, he LOVES this! Absolutely loves it. You can use it to play with your dog or let him sit and chew for a good long while. These bones last a long time and I am sure must be good for his teeth.

I will try to return the second Nylabone for a refund.

I want something that he can chew on that is virtually indestructible.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I gave this to my 14 pound poodle mix for 15 minutes and she had absolutely destroyed it.

I want a refund for it Bc that was a waste of money.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs fight over this, even when they reach have their own.  Yes it leaves little blue pieces everywhere but hey, who doesn't own a broom! At least when they swallow it, it won't kill them. It also lasts a good long time.  At least a good couple months for dauchaunds!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have a 1 year old yorkie she previously had the pink nylabone and loved it and it held up well. However, this one did not last one hour pieces started coming off as she chewed on it. She likes to chew but is not an aggressive chewer, so I thought it should have stood up.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I am so disappointed in this bone. I usually trust Nylabone to be the perfect chewy for my 2 heavy chewers. I bought 2, one for each dog. They lasted less than 1 hour. I will not ever buy these again nor will I recommend these to anyone. The picture was taken 1 hour after delivery.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This didn’t last more than 1 day.  My dog is 1 year so technically still a puppy and only 19 pounds yet this is not strong enough to call a dental chew.  My dog chewed it into small pieces that she could have swallowed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought Th is for my English bulldog puppy because of his teething and it has helped keep his teething a little more under control. He bites the bone when he’s in a chewing mood, which it better than my pant leg!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought 3 of these, one for each dog.They were all destroyed within minutes. Not even worth a dollar and they were $8 a piece. Really disappointed. Would not recommend at all. Not only do they break apart, but then the little nubs can be eaten off as well. Waste of money for sure.</span>]",sticks,fetch toys

However, I think that the sliding pieces should not be so easy to move around. My dog figured out that when she gives a hard shove to the whole board all the sliding pieces will move and then all she has to do is go to the other side and give it a shove that way for the rest....

DO NOT RECOMMEND.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I saw a few reviews mentioning durability, but went ahead and gave it a try based on the price. Thought that wood would be strong enough to last a while, but this is a fiber board made toy, so it's very soft. Within 5 minutes, our 55lb dog broke one of the sliders by trying to pull it with his teeth and the upper part broke off. There were many chew marks on it just from getting into the sliders. The sliders are already very difficult to slide due to the chew marks after only 1 use. The fiberboard also absorbs drool like cardboard. We took it away after he got the food out so the chew marks are all just from him trying to get to the food. 

This toy is probably great for dogs that do not love</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Yorkie loves this toy, however, it’s made of cardboard like material and once it’s out of treats, my girls will dig at it and it tears up quite quickly, so it’s not idea for keeping a dog busy when you go out</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our little guy (mini Aussie, 28 lbs) LOVES this puzzle, in fact he gets all wiggly excited when we pull it out. I’ve found that he’s pretty clever about getting treats from humans, but he enjoys rooting around in puzzles to get fed too. Highly recommend, unless your dog is a big time chewer. It seems like particle board and some cheaper woods were used.

I am sure over time it will break down but it’s nice to know that it is durable enough to hopefully get my money’s worth first! I think it helped that I bought a medium instead of a small size for the pugs because they really had to work at it to chew on it- but the crackle had them so obsessed that they managed to do it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The quality and durability is better than I had expected. I love not hearing a squeak every time my dog bites down on it. My moms dog tried it out before my dog he’s a doxie the dog using the dog is a pit mix and he’s been chewing it all day and hasn’t broken through yet</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was an enormous hit with my bottle cronching puppy... Much less plastic waste, no pieces to gnaw off, satisfying crinkly crunch when chewed. It has a pleasant rubber texture and smells nice (kinda sweet?) and TBH I love the glitter finish. She's still a puppy so I dont know how it will hold up for extreme chewers but she loves it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Originally bought for my puppy who likes it, but my 8 y/o girl LOVES IT! can’t get enough of the crackle sound. Rolls it around for herself and chews on it so happily to hear the noise. Great for fetch in the house too. it make us all laugh at her goofy grin and wagging tail. Definitely recommended, supervise play as always</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The end popped off on the first bite, after that she had it chewed within an hour. Had to remove it, NOT KONG STRONG!!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My girl is a toy terror.  She will kill any toy in minutes or show no interest after the first session if she can't kill it.  This bone is the exception, it gets played with daily and it took over a year for her to actually kill it.  This is the replacement.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We HATE squeak toys and trying to find one that doesn’t squeak is hard. Loved these, the crackle noise isn’t too loud but enough to satisfy and entice our pup. A small piece in the middle did come apart already but not significant enough to be thrown away.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">A number of reviews say that this toy didn't last long with their pet, but my Rottweiler puppy (who loves destroying her toys) always played with this and loved it. Didn't have a problem with the durability until she had the toy (and had used it quite a bit) for about 4-5 months. Then she started to be able to pull away the rubber coating and pull out the plastic inside, so it quickly went in the trash. Overall a pretty good toy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I assumed that since this toy was made from Kong, it was durable. This is not the same material on the Kong toy. Know your chewer before you purchase this. My mini poodle mix would probably hang on to this for a long time. But its first day with my bf’s retriever puppy, his teeth pierced through and it’s slowly being ripped up. I personally don’t like letting dogs play with toys in this state because then you need to worry about making sure the dog doesn’t eat the pieces. Proceed with caution !</span>]",sticks,fetch toys

You have to make sure you get the right size for your dog because that will make a huge difference in durability. I buy the small for the maltese and I get the XL for my am. bully and and it's lasted against the bully's LOVE and obsession of chewing.

Now they are gone within one sitting. It has just become too expensive to maintain his rawhide habit.  I was pleasantly surprised that this chew bone - armed with two little rawhide rings - kept him occupied as long as it did.  The rings lasted about 10 - 15 minutes, and then he played/chewed on it for maybe another 5-10 minutes - long enough to let us eat dinner in peace.  Given what I was paying for rawhide bones this is a tremendous value</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this toy because some one recommended it and oh my goodness i am glad I bought it my dogs love it so much I might have to buy more of them</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs seem to like these toys, but be aware that the size ""small"" for this is not the same ""small"" as other Busy Buddy Toys and requires a smaller treat disc.

It also is fun with just the ball separately. He did find a way to quickly get the chew treats off though.

I can confidently let him chew on it without worrying he’ll be consuming chunks of plastic. Now, I will say, I have to inspect it regularly, and he eventually got through the first layer of the bone after about two months of chewing.

While the squeaker didn’t last long (which I’m not at all mad about), the toy has withstood a heavy chewer (our golden retriever) and is my cocker spaniel’s favorite toy in the whole world.

It is my 20 lb Pekingese’s favorite toy, and he has a lot. I wanted to have a backup in case it was ever lost, so I ordered another on Chewy. I was confused on the size so I ordered both a small and a medium. His first was a small and I was shocked at how big the medium is. I’ll give the medium to a larger dog. My fault for not measuring his old toy. Here’s what I (and my dog) love about this ball: It’s a strong soft substance that my dog hasn’t been able to chew through. My dog can breath easy while carrying it in his mouth. It is great to stick treats or carrot sticks inside and then let my dog work at getting them out. It bounces high</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My rescue has never played, but is very food motivated.

This ball is well made and you can break biscuits in half to make it easier.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My chihuahua loves this ball.  She rolls it around and attacks it as if it were alive.  The teenie Milk Bones are too small for it - they fall out too easily so I'd recommend buying the larger bones (like the ones that come with the ball) and breaking in half if necessary.  The ball is plenty sturdy for a small dog - it'll last a long time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I dont think this would work for an aggressive chewer.

The packaging reads SMALL dogs up to 24lbs. Big Papi aka Harriet is full grown. This ball is way too big for her. Chewy has been kind enough to give me a credit. I will contact Milk Bone also. This ball is even too large for our 30 pound pug.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a great toy for an overactive dog.  It keeps the Spaniel busy for about 10 minutes.

I'm definitely buying more, one for each dog, next time I order.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs loved it so much. I ordered 3 more!! My sons pitpull is a heavy chewer and has minor damage to end. So I hope it will last for him. But our bulldogs have been chasing him around as soon as one dog drops it another is snatching it up to play with it!! Can’t wait to get other ones and fill it up and watch them all enjoy then</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have two dogs, one who’s two and the other who’s twelve. They’re both crazy chewers, and this toy - along with others of the same line - work great for them. It’s sturdy enough for how hard they chew, but soft enough for our older dog who is starting to have dental issues. And it actually smells like bacon, so no weird plastic smell.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 9 almost 10 month old, 55/60lbs, Weizsla (weim/vizsla mix) is a POWER chewer. I cannot find many toys he doesn't destroy in minutes, this being one of them. He freaked out when I gave it to him (not even filled) this morning and in about 10 minutes or less he had the corners completed chewed and was breaking pieces off! I won't buy it again since he had destroyed it in minutes but he did love it so 3 stars for us! Recommend for a smaller dog or slightly less power chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Overall, this is a great product. My border collie-lab pup is happy when we fill it with PB &amp; shredded carrots (usually we freeze it) and give it to him. The hoof is SUPER solid and much heavier than you would expect. However, the fill space is pretty shallow for what I expected; maybe 1-1.5 tablespoons of product at most fit into the opening.</span>]",sticks,fetch toys

It said it was for chewers, so I decided to try it. She accepted it right away &amp; started to chew, so the bacon flavor must be good. However, after the second time of her working on it, I had to take it away because it was REALLY gnawed. I guess I will stay with Kong &amp; Nylabone!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Corgie loved this chew.  The reason for the low rating is that tiny pieces of it would come off and would get caught in his throat.  I finally had to throw it away.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Made well , both dogs enjoy chewing on these  bones . They have lasted longer than most of the toys !</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pitty mix has been chewing on this bone for two weeks, the first one ever to last this long!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Rottweiler wasnt interested in this bone at all. Would not purchase this again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog loves anything bacon flavored. This particular chew keeps him busy for hours. Huge fan of this company &amp; all their chews &amp; toys. so many flavors &amp; different types of chews to choose from. We highly recommend</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our standard poodle absolutely loves this bone! We received it in our Bullymake subscription box (for power chewers) and she immediately took to it. We have since purchased a second, only because and some point she'd chewed it so much that the edges were very sharp and too much debris had collected. It lasted a good 6+ months with hours and hours of entertainment.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Great bone for an aggressive chewer. Over a month and just a little rough around the edges. Keeps him away from chewing other things and entertained for hours at a time.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog likes this bone. She doesn't go crazy for it, but if it's the only chew toy in her grasp she goes for it.  I haven't had any issues with her chewing it so bad that it breaks apart or anything.</span>]",sticks,fetch toys

He is 35 pounds, and the medium I purchased is too large for him. It is also very hard plastic which he doesn't seem to like. The attached treats do not keep his attention. I have a friend whose dog loves his bristle bone, (I gave it extra stars for that) so it's a matter of individual taste, I guess. Not for me and my dog, though.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this for my 73lb pup (almost a year old) who loves to chew. At first, I gave it to him with the treats. He figured it out and got the treats off relatively quickly (but he's pretty smart if I do say so myself). He loves the toy even without the treat, it is his new favorite. The only downside is that the pieces of ""bone"" that stick out dont hold up well. We have had this for about 1 week and one of the ""ears"" is gone. But he is so excited, and it keeps him stimulated and keeps his teeth clean. Plus, putting the treats in is an added bonus here and there. Whenever he destroys this I will absolutely be getting another! All around win</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 55lb Aussie's mouth is not big enough to bite into the center brush area.  He can however, easily pull the treat rings out of brislte bone and eat them seperately and quickly.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is the BEST!!!!! I can not recommend enough. It’s a great size, incredibly durable, AND you can add on new treat rings to keep your pup interested. My dog would not put it down, i think he actually spent over 3/4 hours straight chewing on it the day we received it. It is so so so worth the money. The treat rings are tough to get off, and my pups LOVE the scent/taste of them as well. The best toy ever. I can’t recommend enough</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the second Bristle Bone Dog Toy for our dog. He loves it. I use the rawhide discs with it as well as peanut butter or ‘spray cheese’....cheese in a can..  I am amazed at how much better his teeth look.  He was able to get the end off and chewed the threads on the post. That made it a little difficult to screw it back together.  He has used it so much that I noticed some missing chunks of bristles so I bought a replacement bristle bone toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our dogs love these! We get the raw hides that go with them and it keeps them busy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">No one in my house likes the very strong odor of this toy, including my two Goldens.  I ordered one toy for each of them and neither of my dogs will get near it, even with the little rawhide circles installed.  I might have made a different decision about buying them, if the ""scented"" aspect was in the website description.  

Aside from that, it looks really sturdy and is dishwasher safe.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is a lab mix and I've tried all kinds of things to keep his teeth tartar-free and thought this would do the trick - brushing while he's having fun! On his third session it ended up in pieces: he'd eaten the good bits and quite a bit of the bits that he ought not to have eaten, leaving the bone in pieces. I'd certainly recommend it for smaller dogs though, and for parental-controlled periods (which I was doing) only.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have both sizes of these toys now and our dogs love them.  Make sure to order the correct size of treats that go on.  They get chewed up, but you can still unscrew them and keep using them for a long time.  My sheepadoodgle has the large and the husky has the small.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">She'll play with this thing most of the day if you'll let her!

Within the first 5 minutes it looked like she chewed on it for days, very worn out and there were bamboo/nylon tiny pieces trying to break off already. The pieces aren’t sharp though which I appreciate and they’re easy to just pick off and give back to your dog.
