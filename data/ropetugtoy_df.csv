The squirrel flyer etc were shredded right off but these huge balls , rollers etc he has taken care of- I’d given this away to my next  door neighbors dog who adored it ! I had to give it to him bc he had so much joy for it ! Haha! 
Buying  my big boy another today !</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pup is OBSESSED with this thing.  As a fetch and tug addict, it is absolutely perfect for her.  I first found one at TJMaxx and she played with it for many months, maybe even a year, before she managed to dismantle it (which is pretty impressive, given that she can destroy a stuffed animal in less than 10 minutes).  I was so happy to find it on Chewy!  Unfortunately, the seams on the one I ordered started to rip in just a couple of hours and after few weeks it is completely trashed.  Hoping that I just received a defective product?  I'm back here ordering another one (lol) and keeping my fingers crossed!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is of high quality, similar to the other Chuckit! products. This toy was much larger than I pictured it being and is a little challenging/awkward to throw. I have a 62 pound dog and his front leg has gone through the hole when catching it--I'm not super worried about him getting hurt playing with this but it's not out of the picture. He doesn't seem to mind and wants to play with it often!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have never felt the need/desire to write a review on a dog toy before. Well, this toy has made my almost one year old, Belgian Tervuren the happiest dog ever! He is constantly bringing me this toy to throw for him, to fetch, all day long. There are those few moments when he'll kind of share it with his German Shepard sister, and play tug of war. She is seldom allowed to play with it alone. I have never seen him so in love with a toy before. It seems very well made to withstand all of his abuse. Thank you so much for making this toy!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have two 3 yr old lab mix dogs that are discovering how much they love the lake and the ChuckIt wheel has been a god send. Its easy for them to see and track, easy for them to retrieve and really floats great! I gave it 4 stars because we haven't had it very long, so can't speak on durability just yet! But anyone with young retrievers... GREAT WATER TOY!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog LOVED this thing! He’s a heavy chewer and this lasted us about 3 months. Usually our toys last from 2mins-2 weeks. 
He’s obsessed with anything Chugit. It’s a good toy for dogs who love to fetch and play tug</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I had the smaller one of these before and it lasted for over a year. My second order I got the bigger one.  My dog loves to play rough with this toy and catch it in the air. Very durable, long lasting toy for hours of play.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This product is totally amazing.  We got in April 19 and it has been used daily by out lab/pit and he loves it.  It is easy for them to toss themselves and good to chew on.  We just ordered more to have on hand.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My super chewer boy loves his new wheel. However, even under supervised play he has the lining frayed. Wish it was a bit more durable. But, I will purchase another as he absolutely loves this wheel!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I'm a huge fan of triflyers and since All Kind Toss was out of stock I tried this toy, hoping it would roll and she could chase it. She refuses to retrieve it. I think that one, it doesn't have much weight so it doesn't fly far at all, and two, it is so awkward for her to pick up.</span>]",rope_tug_toys,rope & tug toys

Had to take him to the vet because the rope didn't pass through him without help!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our 8 month puppy is completely into demolishing his toys right now. He’s really exercising his jaws and teeth. So I don’t expect toys to last too long. I did think this rope toy would last longer than an hour. He found the weakness in a side seam and the toy was beyond repair. We still let him play with it but had to remove any stuffing. I think it’s a great toy if your pup wants to play tug of war and isn’t so much into tug and  destroy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I buy and endorse Kong toys on a regular basis, but this one was a disappointment.  The tug ropes on each end are too small for an adult hand to hang onto,  The squeaker is a HUGE disappointment.  It is located in just one of the legs and very hard to find.  It barely squeaked.  The inside of the toy is rope like the handles, but it's not a chew toy, so I'm confused.  It was a gift for a friend's new puppy - he didn't seem intrigued.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">we received this as a gift to our new puppy who’s 9mo. It broke within ten seconds of her playing with it. The ropes completely tore apart and our puppy was eating them within a blink of an eye—I’m not kidding. I wish I was. I’ve never seen a dog toy rip apart so easily. Our puppy is 50lbs and not a very aggressive chewer so it was quite startling to have the toy completely break and fall apart within seconds of having it. I had to cut the rope part off just so she could still remotely play with it since she was starting to try to eat the torn rope ends. I would not recommend this toy unless your dog literally does chew at all.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Both my 80+ lb boxer dogs love this toy. They play tug a war. It has held up well and this is my second one of this style, the other was a monkey I bought quite a while ago, he is still surviving.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It is recommended as a tough chew toy, but my dogs had both the fluff and the rope ends pulled out within an hour. Very disappointed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Archie was able to completely deconstruct this thing rather quickly; even the tug o’ war element. I realize nothing lasts forever, especially when given to a 80lb monster with jaws of steel. However, the people at Kong are wacky if they think this product is a deal at nearly $20. Not the worst, but certainly not a house favorite.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We thought we’d give Kong tuggerknots toys a try, as they have a good reputation for quality. Our Airedales love to play with relatively soft toys, especially with a squeaker, but they have a knack for chewing off the fabric. I wish Kong would make a plush like toy for dogs who need to use the black Kong for biting (they can destroy the red ones). Still on the hunt for the elusive perfect plush toy for hard chewers.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog peeled the felt off of the middle in a matter of minutes.  I was surprised because Kong toys usually last longer.  I ended up throwing it away.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I purchased this in the hopes that my Staffy mix, who only has half his teeth, would be able to have a longer lasting tug toy. He definitely did love this toy as promised but had it destroyed within 2 hours. The handles knawed apart and the inner rope exposed. He had a great time with the toy, it's just not as long lasting as claimed.</span>]",rope_tug_toys,rope & tug toys

Not like 99% of other American companies that make these types of items but manufacture them in China.

It is an awesome toy for throwing and floats in the water as well, so you can play in a variety of ways. My dog and I have fun playing tug with it as well. It is easy to hold.

Not sure why everyone is complaining about their dog chewing it (I get they claim it is super durable, so it is disappointing.). However, it is not meant to be a chew toy, so if you have a touch chewer don't let them sit and chew on it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Not for ""tenaciously tough"" chewers! This thing lasted all of 5min before my 5mo old shepherd/Dobie turned it into confetti all over the living room.  He absolutely LOVED this toy prior to, hence the 3 stars. But we made the mistake of letting him chew on it for 4.5min longer than previously allowed, and the next time I looked over it was 100% ANNIHILATED.

I had the highest of hopes for this one! They pulled, they tugged, they chewed they ran around throwing it in the air like a dead snake, I was SO EXCITED and ready to buy 3 more. Then one of them finally achieved their goal of destruction and chewed off the end. But it lasted a good 4-5 hours! I would highly recommend this toy for almost any other dog. And I will continue searching for something they cannot destroy. SIGH.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We purchased this because it was also a water toy.  We have a lab who was afraid of the water but insisted on stopping people from jumping in the pool because she  couldn't ""save"" them.

She loves regular Jolly Balls, but after a couple of weeks of play would rip the handles off of them from swinging them around. This version of the toy is great in that it has a rope through it that she can use to swing the ball around instead of an attached handle that can break off. The ball itself is much more rigid than a straight Jolly Ball, and feels a little heavier, but that doesn't stop her from whipping it around. Highly recommend for larger, strong dogs who like a good game of tug or for dogs who like to roughhouse with big toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have an ACD that loves to destroy toys.  This toy is definitely his favorite.  Thank goodness it can withstand his chewing and he grabs the rope to sling it back and forth.

I think this is a great puppy bundle for small to medium puppies. The ropes are very durable for my little pup. I would think a larger puppy may outgrow these faster then you'd like but it would still be a great bundle regardless just an fyi the toys are on the smaller side.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I recently got a new pup and got this bundle. When it first arrived, I was actually missing half the toys (there’s supposed to be 6) I contacted Chewy immediately and I sent me another pack! My puppy’s favorite toy from this bundle is the rope with the tassel ends, giraffe, and bone.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Cavachon puppy LOVES every toy in this pack! When we first unpacked it, she couldn’t decide what to play with first and is taking turns trying them all out! She loves that the squeakers are smaller so she can squeak them herself!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our new fur baby loves her toys we bought in this pack.  The only one that won't is the big rope.  it is three times as big as she is.  So we will keep that for when she is much older, as she will only be 10-11 pounds full grown.  Or it will be a gift to my grand-dogs.  The orders from Chewy arrive quickly and as promised so far.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Great price with a nice assortment! The plush toys are made for cuddler dogs not chewers but I am completely happy with the price and quality of the items recieved! I bought these for my pitbull puppy she loves her toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 12 week old corgi puppy is obsessed with all of these toys!!! Such a.good value set!!! Her favorites are the giraffe and the tug a war rope but she plays with all of them! So happy I got this!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This pack of toys is so amazing my dog loves them he is 4 months old and is very crazy when comes to playing all toys are still in tact! The ropes are also great for chewing on incase his teeth hurt! He loves the giraffe because of the noise and they all still make noices!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">These toys are great. The big rope pulled out of the wrap almost immediately but we just tied a knot at each end and works just fine. We were able to split the set between the big brother and baby sister perfectly. Now they just steal them from one another.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My daughter just got a new puppy I wanted to send a welcome gift.
My dog passed in March, Chewy has always been wonderful wanted to share this wonderful company with her.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This pack would be best suited for smaller dogs or puppies. Most of the toys are no bigger than my hand. For the price, it would probably make a great starter pack for a new puppy owner.</span>]",rope_tug_toys,rope & tug toys
