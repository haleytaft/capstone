Durable too</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We've tried various toys for playing with our dog in our pond and this one is by far the best.  It's easy to throw with the attached rope and it floats above the water so it's easy for a dog to see.  It seems impervious to pond water muck and leeches.  Our dog does not chew on this toy so I can't speak for that aspect, but in all other ways, it works perfectly.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It throws well, it's got great visibility, it's easy for my husky to grab, and it dries fairly quickly. Plus she loves the little string on the end; every time it moves she throws it down and pounces on it like a fearsome huntress!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We've used this for several swims now. It stays afloat, and the bright color makes it easy for the pups to track. The cutest thing ever is when my pup and my parent's pup retrieve it together. Definitely worth the money!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The toy tore immediately and I called Chewy and they sent another one. The second one did the same thing. The rubber one is much better quality.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Chuck-It products is the Gold Standard for dog toys.  I have purchased a variety of their products and they have never disappointed.  Very tough and outstanding quality.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I would not recommend these unless your dog doesn't have teeth. My 10 month old GSD LOVED these but the stitching starting coming apart on day one and the bumpers were completely destroyed by day 2.  Very disappointed, I wish they would re-engineer these with stronger stitching.  I would buy them again if they were re-engineered however would NEVER buy them again as is.  Very poorly constructed.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs love this toy! It’s a toy not a chew toy! Many have posted pics chewed up toys. I limit this to play time. When done I take it away. I have a Bernedoodle and Dobie. This toy lasted a long time until a family member left it outside and the Dobie tore it to shreds. He tears everything to shreds because he’s a chewer. I’m buying another today!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Boston terriers LOVE this toy!

I saw the plastic pieces and checked for the squeaker and couldn’t find it. Got a bit worried so I cut a slit in the other end and was happy to see there is no plastic squeaker! It’s a tube inside the bulb, and hollow otherwise. I’m not sure that I’d buy this again, given it didn’t hold up like the black Kong products do, but it’s good to know there’s no squeaker hazard. And the end I cut still squeaks!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 80 pound catahoula love this thing. I don't necessarily like getting smacked in the leg by it when he shakes it like a squirrel, lol, but he has so much fun with it I'm willing to let that go. It's big enough for tug of war, tough enough for chewing, and squeaks just enough for him to stay interested but not so much that everyone in the room gets a headache. Definitely one of our favorite toys.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy held up for 2 months with my dog primarily playing fetch on land and in water. The true test began when I started taking it with us to the dog park. It survived for several play sessions, but once the dogs started tugging on it they were able to rip the bulbs off the end. However, I would purchase again as it’s a durable toy and it provided my pittie with many enjoyable play sessions.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy is unbelievably fun for my dogs.  It is sturdy for my chewers, who usually demolish toys within minutes.  The squeaking stimulates them to step on it, carry it around, toss it from their mouths and try to play tug o war.  It's a tough toy, and I'm so glad I discovered it for my doggies.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog (2 year old border collie), destroys everything I get him that says it’s for tough chewers and it’s really frustrating when you drop a good amount of money on it. But this one is affordable and he has a blast with it. It’s perfect length for tug of war plus the squeakers get him even more excited. 
Would definitely recommend:)</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our Goldendoodle is a toy destroyer and this one doesn’t even have a tooth mark on it after a couple weeks of play. He loves to use those tiny front teeth to try to pull the seams apart. Both ends are squeakers which is a great surprise and joy to our pup. Great toy for fetch and doesn’t bounce super high so safer for indoor tossing as well.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 50lb bully destroys everything she that goes into her mouth. I've had one of these babies for almost 9 months. While she did shred the squeakers on the ends within one month, the center stick has continued to last. It's her absolute favorite toy and she carries it almost everywhere. She's been slowly biting off bits from the ends but it's a pretty solid stick so it will take her a while. I bought 2 more and give her access to the new ones that still have intact squeakers every now and then, but otherwise she's perfectly happy with her squeaker-less center stick piece.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My lab usually destroys everything and we have had issues in the past with toys. So he doesn’t have many. Kong came through again with this toy. It has held up and makes him happy. I find my dog napping with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I really like this toy and I had very high hopes that it would last. I have two strong chewers and they chewed through the end after having the toy only two days. But even busted, I can still throw it around and play fetch with it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pit LOVES to chew his toys especially squeaking ones they are his favorite but his 1st goal is to get to that squeaker. Anyways this is in my top 5 toys I can get him that actually lasts. Yes he had those squeakers broken the 1st day but he still loves to chew on this and it hasnt been chewed up yet so I will for sure buy again for him.</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/kong-squeakstix-dog-toy-large/dp/236380,rope_tug_toys,rope & tug toys

The material, however, is not very chew resistant and considering that this is supposed to be a chew toy, we were very disappointed. It lasted less than 1 day before he was chewing off tiny pieces that he was swallowing. That was the end of that toy - in the trash it went!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The quality and durability is better than I had expected. I love not hearing a squeak every time my dog bites down on it. My moms dog tried it out before my dog he’s a doxie the dog using the dog is a pit mix and he’s been chewing it all day and hasn’t broken through yet</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This was an enormous hit with my bottle cronching puppy... Much less plastic waste, no pieces to gnaw off, satisfying crinkly crunch when chewed. It has a pleasant rubber texture and smells nice (kinda sweet?) and TBH I love the glitter finish. She's still a puppy so I dont know how it will hold up for extreme chewers but she loves it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Originally bought for my puppy who likes it, but my 8 y/o girl LOVES IT! can’t get enough of the crackle sound.

Definitely recommended, supervise play as always</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I saw the pictures of broken off pieces on other reviews after I purchased this. However, two of my tough chewers have been gnawing on it all day for two days and it is perfectly in tact. I am sure over time it will break down but it’s nice to know that it is durable enough to hopefully get my money’s worth first! I think it helped that I bought a medium instead of a small size for the pugs because they really had to work at it to chew on it- but the crackle had them so obsessed that they managed to do it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">The end popped off on the first bite, after that she had it chewed within an hour. Had to remove it, NOT KONG STRONG!!!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I purchased this because of the Kong brand. Unfortunately after a couple days, my dog was able to chew the end right off</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">A number of reviews say that this toy didn't last long with their pet, but my Rottweiler puppy (who loves destroying her toys) always played with this and loved it. Didn't have a problem with the durability until she had the toy (and had used it quite a bit) for about 4-5 months. Then she started to be able to pull away the rubber coating and pull out the plastic inside, so it quickly went in the trash. Overall a pretty good toy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I assumed that since this toy was made from Kong, it was durable. This is not the same material on the Kong toy. Know your chewer before you purchase this. My mini poodle mix would probably hang on to this for a long time. But its first day with my bf’s retriever puppy, his teeth pierced through and it’s slowly being ripped up. I personally don’t like letting dogs play with toys in this state because then you need to worry about making sure the dog doesn’t eat the pieces. Proceed with caution !</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog is not an obsessive chewer, but she is a wild player. Within a few hours of fetch and vigorous head shaking it was beginning to crack apart. The crackle center fell out after the second day.

I wanted to use it as a fetch toy in the pool for my border collie. She did not seem to care for it. At first I was disappointed with this purchase. My great dane mix, grand pup, loves it! He plays with it often and hasn't destroyed it as he does almost everything else he touches! LOL He is not necessarily an aggressive chewer but the power of his jaws seems to destroy most things.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Ordered the large for my 50+ lb bully mix. He loves running and whipping this stick around. It is super flexible, so it’s even more fun for him.

I am glad I got the large, bc it is too long for him to get a real grip to chew and destroy. It is not super tough, so obviously don’t leave your dog to chew on it. It has completely held up to him shaking, running, and a little inevitable chewing.

I didnt know its that long and heavy:( but loved it tho so I had to re-order for small size and its perfect !

Bought two other things; Ruff Dawg Stick Dog Fetch Toy, Color Varies, Stick
Chuckit! Fetch Wheel Dog Toy, Small/ All three things are perfect and love them.
Thanks Chew for selling these.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This big stick  purchase proved to be a safe option to having my 75 lb. Doberman retrieve sticks.  She had a habit of crunching a stick into splinters. Often times her mouth would be bloody and she would ingest portions of the sticks. This option is totally safe and allows her to chew as she runs during her victory lap. Thanks Chewy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We got the medium for my 20 pound rat terrier. The length and girth of the stick seem appropriate but it's a little heavy for her. That's okay - she still likes to swing it around and whack peoples' ankles with it. We had no preference about the color, but the stick we received is light blue.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Like always, kong, you are amazing.

This toy makes us all happy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Ive had my husky/rottie mix for two months now and finding toys that she doesn’t shred in seconds has been difficult. I was not expecting this toy to be so big, but it’s perfect. She loves playing tug with it and it’s been one week and she has barely even frayed the edges. I will continue to buy this whenever she does end up  chewing it to its death.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">It's too bad because my dog loves to tug. He likes soft things (no ropes).

Fortunately it is soft.I will definitely order a second to hide in the closet in case this one dies. It is their favorite new toy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I've seen a lot of bad reviews saying that their dogs have ripped this toy to shreds. One thing I want to mention is that this is NOT to be used as a chew toy it's an INTERACTIVE toy which is written on the package when you get it. So if you have no intentions of actually playing with your dog don't buy this. You can save some money but buying a bone instead. I have an 80lb pitty who destroys ""durable"" toys like it's his job. He however hasn't destroyed this one yet and the reason why is not because it's ""indestructible"" but because when I'm done playing with this toy it gets put up until next time increasing it's usability. My only real complaint is that the holes are a bit small for my average</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">One of the best toys ever purchased!! We have a Dane that is an aggressive chewer and love to play tug o war!!

He tends to bite on the edges of the toy more, and the seams are coming undone. He killed the squeakers in about 15 minutes of play time. He is a mild chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is a very rugged toy, and my power-chewer hasn't put a dent in it in. But that's really all I can say for it. Too big and too ungainly for my girl. I wish I'd gone for a smaller toy for her. I'd recommend this item for a larger dog that is a strong chewer.

Pros:
I've had it for a few weeks now, and my 50-lb. adolescent foxhound hasn't been able to so much as fray the edging on it, which is more than I can say about any other toys she's ever had. That alone accounts for the 3 points I'm giving this item. 

Cons:
1) It's just too big and unwieldy for her. She's a big, tall hound dog with a long muzzle, so toys for ""medium sized dogs"" don't usually stand up to her chewing efforts, that's</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Labbies are very tough on anything, but the TUFFY ""pull"" toy is awesome and I highly recommend for the active pups !</span>]",https://www.chewy.com/tuffys-ultimate-tug-o-war-squeaky/dp/39288,rope_tug_toys,rope & tug toys

It’s the first toy she runs to when she wants to play in the yard. But will it break if your dog is an aggressive chewer? Yes, it’s not made of tough rubber and string can never hold up well to a rough chewer.

I first found one at TJMaxx and she played with it for many months, maybe even a year, before she managed to dismantle it (which is pretty impressive, given that she can destroy a stuffed animal in less than 10 minutes).  I was so happy to find it on Chewy!  Unfortunately, the seams on the one I ordered started to rip in just a couple of hours and after few weeks it is completely trashed.

Well, this toy has made my almost one year old, Belgian Tervuren the happiest dog ever! He is constantly bringing me this toy to throw for him, to fetch, all day long. There are those few moments when he'll kind of share it with his German Shepard sister, and play tug of war. She is seldom allowed to play with it alone. I have never seen him so in love with a toy before. It seems very well made to withstand all of his abuse. Thank you so much for making this toy!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have two 3 yr old lab mix dogs that are discovering how much they love the lake and the ChuckIt wheel has been a god send.

Not sure why everyone is complaining about their dog chewing it (I get they claim it is super durable, so it is disappointing.).

And I will continue searching for something they cannot destroy. SIGH.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We purchased this because it was also a water toy.

Do not reccomend.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I was really excited to get this toy. My dog loves all things pigs. He loved this toy instantly, but was able to pull the squeaker piece out within an hour. The rest of the toy is super durable and to be honest, the squeaking noise was annoying, so I’m not upset that I had to throw that piece out. Just something to be aware of if you have a chewer.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This is the silliest toy.  My dog absolutely loves this silly toy.  Especially the noise it makes.  She is so cute pouncing on it, pushing it with her paws and trying to carry it around.

He loves to play with it by himself just chewing on it, playing tug-a-war with other dogs or us, or parading it around like a trophy.
This toy has held up better than any other chew toy and it is soft so it doesn't hurt his teeth but still exercises his chaws and teeth.
We also like the bright color, which makes it easy to find when he takes it outside in the yard.

We would definitely buy it again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">We have a 50 lb collie mix who destroys most toys in minutes. We've had this bone for 2+ years and it's still in good shape. He chews on it almost daily, and we play tug of war with him with it and it has held up well. It doesn't get rough edges like nylon based toys, so I don't worry about it hurting his mouth and we can grip it easily. This is literally the only toy that he hasn't destroyed. Please make more like it!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog enjoyed a few treats and peanut butter crammed in both sides, immediately after he enjoyed the treat he started to split the ends so I took it away. Unfortunately one of the toddlers let him have it back and he's spent the last few weeks destroying it and ripping it into smaller pieces. Apparently I didn't pick up some fast enough and found them the other day after some rain in a pile in the yard. If you have a tough chewer I wouldn't get this toy, it won't last long.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this at a local retailer. I didn’t realize Chewy sold it. I’m so happy that they do. This toy is GREAT!! Both my 7 year old Samoyed Siberian Husky and my 9 month old Collie Pyrenees love IT!!

At first I was shocked to see my Husky interacting with it. He rarely ever plays. Then I got a little worried that he was going to chew through it. But this toy is true to its name, it’s definitely bionic. 

My collie who normally destroys his toys after 2 days, hasn’t been able to cause any damage to this :) 

Also I stuff both ends with treats  to keep them more engaged. But it would be nice if the depth of the toy  was longer so I could stuff more treats in it.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog Riddick really loves this treat-toy!

This is a good one!!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">This toy was advertised as being good for tough chewers.  It's even in the name. I bought two of them because my GSPs, one of whom is a puppy, love to chew. It took the puppy less than 10 minutes to chew through the ends of this toy.  Mercifully, it looks as though she spit out the tiny pieces: I was finding them everywhere.  I will never buy anything from this company again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My boy who destroys everything plays with this and has not been able to make a dent in it. He carries it around, plays tug and chews on it. It would get. 5 if it had a squeaker or made a crinkly noise, but without any noise, he loses interest in it quickly.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Our pit mix loves this toy! It seems like it won't hold up forever to her chomping, so we only get it out to play fetch outside. She loves it - seemingly because it's heavy and fun to trot around with, and she clearly loves the chewy-rubbery texture too.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I got this toy for my daughters dog to pay with my dog when they come to visit. My problem has been I have a small 20 lb Frenchie and she has a 50 lb active dog. When they are together, its wild times and major tug of war. Normally the larger dog destroys every toy but NOT this one. Its a good size for each of them and the perfect durability and weight for both sizes.

She is an avid chewer and will destroy any toy that isn't durable and this toy is holding up so far.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this a year or so ago for my pit bull, and he still loves it. When we added a new Rhodesian Ridgeback puppy to our family in July, this was the first toy she grabbed (though it was MUCH too big for her at the time). At 10 months she's now over 75lbs. Both dogs adore this toy. I think it's easy to carry, and it's hollow inside - so they can chew and chew and get a satisfying squish, but they can't chew off pieces of it. The pup likes to flip it up in the air and watch it bounce, then pounces on it. And, even with full-on tug-of-war games between a 70lbs pit bull and a 75lbs rigdeback pup, it still looks perfect.

This one is perfect because the ball gets just the right amount of bounce when I swing it by the rope, so my dogs go nuts trying to catch it and follow it around. 
And also because the ball slips to the other side of the rope certain times they’ll just boop the ball and have to keep chasing it, but when they catch the rope we play tug for a bit before they’re instructed to drop it. 
Once they’re nice and tired, I put it away. My “four stars” is for the rope...

This is, by far, her favorite. She loves to chase the ball, and LOVES to play tug-of-war with it when she brings it back to us. The size was perfect for her (6-inch size, 60 pound Pointer), and the ball held up well against her abuse. The rope was destroyed after about an hour or two of playtime, but we expected as much, as our dog is known to destroy her toys with great relish. I can see myself buying this toy in future summers, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a good backyard toy!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs love this ball. The ball is durable &amp; can kick it without breaking a toe. I rated 4 stars because the rope is not that durable. I do have 3 big dogs. The rope lasted a day but the ball is great. This is my 2nd one.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I have another one of these in the same size, but different color. The blue one I have is solid, sturdy, and has lasted several months. This one had a puncture hole in it within 5 minutes - completely different than the blue one and a total waste of money. It’s actually such poor quality that I wonder if it’s not even the real jolly brand!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this toy for my 9 dogs as one of their Christmas gifts. It’s survived a week of tugging and tossing between a variety of different breeds &amp; sizes from pit bull mixes to a Jack Russel. It’s of good quality and should last a couple of months at least.

Great quality product. I ordered the blue combo, non squeaker version and it was exactly what I wanted. Fleece is gentle on dog’s teeth and very durable. The length is great for a 25lbs dog to play tug and retrieve with. This is thicker than the one that attaches to the flirt pole, so it may be good for dogs 20-50lbs with no problem.

I wish these came in a variety of colors, since I like to color coat my dogs’ gear. Red, pink, hunter green would be so awesome!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My pitbull destroyed in 5 minutes.
If you have a small dog or one who isn't an aggressive chewer, this would be a good toy.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">we have a Shih Tzu, this polar fleece type tug toy, works perfect for a fun play time.  easy on the hands and on his mouth</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dogs loved this and chased each other around the house playing with it for about a week. I have two dogs, one about 50 pounds and one about 80 pounds. I was surprised by how long it lasted because it was very soft. It was one toy I didn’t mind on the bed. I think if I would have watched to make sure they were playing instead of just chewing it,  it would have lasted a lot longer. I have found stronger power-chewer items, so I wouldn’t recommend it to a power chewer based on that description.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My dog likes these toys and they hold up pretty good. Think they are priced a bit high for what it costs to make them.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My 110lb Great Dane Saint Bernard mix chews through EVERY toy!! This one has lasted her almost three months and is just started to show some fraying in the top! Wear and tear because she like to put the ring in her mouth and chew on it! Will definitely be buying again once she breaks the one she has now! Wish they had more toys that were fleece like this one!</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">My Pittie is a playful guy.  He was so excited for his toy but noticed in less than a hour he was able to tear it apart.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">I bought this as a reward toy while training. It's perfect for this! The size it just right as a reward tug and it's easy enough to stuff it in my back pocket until I need it again.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Purchased this in December 2018 for my Pit, Bassett, Blue Healer mix. He has ripped every toy to shreds within days of having it. But here I sit 5 months later in awe that the toy is still in tact. He loves this toy and has not torn it to pieces yet. There's just one hole in it and a tiny fray in the rope. This is DEFINITELY a score for tough chewers.  I just wish there was a toy that would keep him from eating my couch.</span>, <span class=""ugc-list__review__display"">Not long lasting or durable.
