    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "Based off the reviews of dog toys, and a person's description of their dog's general personality, I will create a recommendation system that will suggest what type of toy your dog might like, and potential toys for your dog to try. "

    "## My Approach:\n",
    "For this recommendation system I plan to/am taking dog toy reviews from [Chewy.com](https://www.chewy.com/) and potentially other dog toy websites. With this data, I plan to create an item-based recommendation system which will take the types of toys a dog previously has had, and it's characteristics to find toys that are similar or slightly different for a dog to try.  \n"

    "## My data\n",
    "\n",
    "As I said above, I will be scraping dog toy reviews from Chewy. To do this, I will use Selenium and I believe XPath in order to navigate Chewy's website and collect data about the different toys as well as the toys' reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer:** I know that we are supposed to have our data collected by this point, but I have had some difficulties figuring out the exact path I would like to take with my project and have had to prioritize Project 5 as well. I have started researching Selenium and practicing one simple examples. The links I am looking at are:   \n",

    " - [Selenium with Python](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/index.html)\n",
    " \n",
    "So far I have been working on using Selenium to navigate through Chewy's website to the different pages of dog doys that I want to scrape. My next step will obviously be to start scraping the different features of the toys and storing them in a dataframe. I am currently working through some issues, where when I run my notebook, it will sometimes navigate through a certain number of pages, but then crash and sometimes work. Not sure if this means I will need to scrape in steps or maybe make sure I am waiting long enough between number of interactions with the site. Either way, I am not quite sure still what is happening so I will have to look into that as well. To conduct my scraping, I am using a jupyter notebook. I have also included the code I have so far below. \n",
