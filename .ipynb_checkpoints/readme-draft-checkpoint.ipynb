    "**Data Collection** \n",
    " - Using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, scraped dog toys from [Chewy.com](https://www.chewy.com) The categories of toys I scraped are chew toys, plush toys, fetch toys, interactive toys and rope and tug toys. \n",
    " - The features that I scraped include: title, price, overall rating, description, key benefits (if this section exists), and reviews as well as the link to the toy's webpage. \n",
    " - This process was definitely the greatest challenge due to overloading the website and computer capacity. I had to make sure to take it step by step in order to ensure that I did not overwhelm Chewy as well as my computer. \n",
    " - Cleaned unneccessary characters from each column. For example, the \"\\$\" in the price and some html characters that got collected in the scraping process by accident. \n",
    " - Since I scraped toys by each category, I had to combine them all into one large dataframe to use. "

    "Preprocessing:\n",
    " - I created a new column, combining the text from the toys' description, key benefits (if present) and reviews which would then be used in analyzing the toys. \n",
    " - I then tokenized this column and removed stop words and other words I thought would not hold much meaning such as various forms of 'dog' and 'toy' since all the text was talking about dog toys. \n",
    " - I used spaCy to vectorize and then manually calculated the average vector for each toy's text for EDA. \n",
    "\n",
    "EDA: **ADD IN SOME FINDINGS**\n",
    " - Looked at the count of toys in each category and subcategory. This showed me that for some reason, there was only one toy in the ball subcategory and that I would have to rescrape data once more toys were added back to the website. \n",
    " - I also used CountVectorization to look at most commons words amongst the whole dataframe and then among each category to see if there were any words that were or were not common among all categories. \n",
    " - I also looked at the overall rating and how they were distributed amongst each category and how those categories compared to each other. \n",
    " - Lastly, I looked at how the vectors were distributed in the whole dataframe and then by category to again see if there were any major differences in the text of each category. "

    "     - Is your dog a puppy, or older?\n",
    "     - Is your dog super energetic and playful or calmer?\n",
    "     - Would you say your dog is smarter than most dogs?\n",

For the most part, he is pretty mellow, but sometimes gets bursts of energy, especially when we go swimming and playing fetch in the pool with a ball. He also really like treats and is very food oriented. He will get bored with a toy after a bit. His favorite toy is probably a ball.\"\n",

He is also extremely destructive and destroys almost every toy we have. He loves squeaky toys and will chew and destroys them for hours.”\n",

She can also be quite destructive and loves to chew on things and lick. The second she sees something she chases and barks after it like a little guard dog\"\n",

    "- I was able to create a working system. There is definitely room for improvement like with most projects, but for where it stands now I am very happy with it because it provides pretty good results from my opinion. \n",
    "- I have also created a web app for users to be able to use my system. Hopeufully I will be able to turn this into a website or some sort of app for people to be able to access, since now it is only able to run with the streamlit library. \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Future Steps** \n",
    "- I definitely want to work on my web app to make it more efficient and appealing for users both visually and informatively. \n",
    "- I would also like to look into including more stores or more animals in my system beyond Chewy and dogs so that more people could use it. \n",
    "- Due to timing issues, I was not able to scrape all reviews from the products, so I would like to be able to go back and do that so then I can conduct sentiment analysis on the reviews.\n",
