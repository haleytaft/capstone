Tho nothing is dog proof this stuff held up much much longer than any other brand !! The squirrel flyer etc were shredded right off but these huge balls , rollers etc he has taken care of- I’d given this away to my next  door neighbors dog who adored it ! I had to give it to him bc he had so much joy for it ! Haha! \n",
       "   Buying  my big boy another today !</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My pup is OBSESSED with this thing.  As a fetch and tug addict, it is absolutely perfect for her.  I first found one at TJMaxx and she played with it for many months, maybe even a year, before she managed to dismantle it (which is pretty impressive, given that she can destroy a stuffed animal in less than 10 minutes).  I was so happy to find it on Chewy!  Unfortunately, the seams on the one I ordered started to rip in just a couple of hours and after few weeks it is completely trashed.  Hoping that I just received a defective product?  I'm back here ordering another one (lol) and keeping my fingers crossed!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This toy is of high quality, similar to the other Chuckit! products. This toy was much larger than I pictured it being and is a little challenging/awkward to throw. I have a 62 pound dog and his front leg has gone through the hole when catching it--I'm not super worried about him getting hurt playing with this but it's not out of the picture. He doesn't seem to mind and wants to play with it often!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have never felt the need/desire to write a review on a dog toy before. Well, this toy has made my almost one year old, Belgian Tervuren the happiest dog ever! He is constantly bringing me this toy to throw for him, to fetch, all day long. There are those few moments when he'll kind of share it with his German Shepard sister, and play tug of war. She is seldom allowed to play with it alone. I have never seen him so in love with a toy before. It seems very well made to withstand all of his abuse. Thank you so much for making this toy!!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We have two 3 yr old lab mix dogs that are discovering how much they love the lake and the ChuckIt wheel has been a god send. Its easy for them to see and track, easy for them to retrieve and really floats great! I gave it 4 stars because we haven't had it very long, so can't speak on durability just yet! But anyone with young retrievers... GREAT WATER TOY!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog LOVED this thing! He’s a heavy chewer and this lasted us about 3 months. Usually our toys last from 2mins-2 weeks. \n",
       "   He’s obsessed with anything Chugit. It’s a good toy for dogs who love to fetch and play tug</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I had the smaller one of these before and it lasted for over a year. My second order I got the bigger one.  My dog loves to play rough with this toy and catch it in the air. Very durable, long lasting toy for hours of play.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This product is totally amazing.  We got in April 19 and it has been used daily by out lab/pit and he loves it.  It is easy for them to toss themselves and good to chew on.  We just ordered more to have on hand.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My super chewer boy loves his new wheel. However, even under supervised play he has the lining frayed. Wish it was a bit more durable. But, I will purchase another as he absolutely loves this wheel!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I'm a huge fan of triflyers and since All Kind Toss was out of stock I tried this toy, hoping it would roll and she could chase it. She refuses to retrieve it. I think that one, it doesn't have much weight so it doesn't fly far at all, and two, it is so awkward for her to pick up.</span>]},\n",

He ripped right through it and shredded it without us knowing. He tore out the stuffing and squeaker then ate some of the rope and fabric. Had to take him to the vet because the rope didn't pass through him without help!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our 8 month puppy is completely into demolishing his toys right now. He’s really exercising his jaws and teeth. So I don’t expect toys to last too long. I did think this rope toy would last longer than an hour. He found the weakness in a side seam and the toy was beyond repair. We still let him play with it but had to remove any stuffing. I think it’s a great toy if your pup wants to play tug of war and isn’t so much into tug and  destroy.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I buy and endorse Kong toys on a regular basis, but this one was a disappointment.  The tug ropes on each end are too small for an adult hand to hang onto,  The squeaker is a HUGE disappointment.  It is located in just one of the legs and very hard to find.  It barely squeaked.  The inside of the toy is rope like the handles, but it's not a chew toy, so I'm confused.  It was a gift for a friend's new puppy - he didn't seem intrigued.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">we received this as a gift to our new puppy who’s 9mo. It broke within ten seconds of her playing with it. The ropes completely tore apart and our puppy was eating them within a blink of an eye—I’m not kidding. I wish I was. I’ve never seen a dog toy rip apart so easily. Our puppy is 50lbs and not a very aggressive chewer so it was quite startling to have the toy completely break and fall apart within seconds of having it. I had to cut the rope part off just so she could still remotely play with it since she was starting to try to eat the torn rope ends. I would not recommend this toy unless your dog literally does chew at all.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Both my 80+ lb boxer dogs love this toy. They play tug a war. It has held up well and this is my second one of this style, the other was a monkey I bought quite a while ago, he is still surviving.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">It is recommended as a tough chew toy, but my dogs had both the fluff and the rope ends pulled out within an hour. Very disappointed.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Archie was able to completely deconstruct this thing rather quickly; even the tug o’ war element. I realize nothing lasts forever, especially when given to a 80lb monster with jaws of steel. However, the people at Kong are wacky if they think this product is a deal at nearly $20. Not the worst, but certainly not a house favorite.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We thought we’d give Kong tuggerknots toys a try, as they have a good reputation for quality. Our Airedales love to play with relatively soft toys, especially with a squeaker, but they have a knack for chewing off the fabric. I wish Kong would make a plush like toy for dogs who need to use the black Kong for biting (they can destroy the red ones). Still on the hunt for the elusive perfect plush toy for hard chewers.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog peeled the felt off of the middle in a matter of minutes.  I was surprised because Kong toys usually last longer.  I ended up throwing it away.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I purchased this in the hopes that my Staffy mix, who only has half his teeth, would be able to have a longer lasting tug toy. He definitely did love this toy as promised but had it destroyed within 2 hours. The handles knawed apart and the inner rope exposed. He had a great time with the toy, it's just not as long lasting as claimed.</span>]},\n",

But she still continues to toss it around or will ask to play a game of tug with it...</span>,\n",

I fill it with ice cubes, smash them lightly with a meat tenderizer, close it up tightly with the Velcro, and then let my GSD and collie puppies chew on it. It soothes their swollen gums  and gives them something soft and crunchy and satisfying to bite down on. Saves my poor ankles and garden shoes.</span>,\n",

He loves this toy, but it works much better for him with a thicker Gatorade bottle rather than a water bottle.

He will also leave you with barely any rope for you to play along. Sally allowed me and Cocoa to have plenty of places to grab and hold onto. Now I don't have to worry about losing a finger haha.

The only problem was it was short enough that we could really play tug-of-war. Then he killed it about a month later. He was devastated. I tried the Mammoth size and it's HUGE! He was so excited, he drags it everywhere and it's long enough for tug-of-war and he hasn't chewed threw the ball yet. Perfect!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our girl who we call the annihilator has been enjoying this toy.  She likes to chase it, run past it then maybe eventually bring it back(she is not the the best at fetch)!  What she does do though is carry it around and chews it...it has lasted so far.  So in all seriousness, when this toy finally gives out(which is not for a while yet by the looks of it), we'll be getting her another one.</span>,\n",

In one hour he peeled all of the fuzz off and split the ball (which was smaller than I expected). He then was able to bite thru the rope’s knot. Destroying toys brings him joy, so under careful supervision I let him have at it. On to the next one..</span>,\n",

I bring a few special toys out, and each time my neighbor dog comes by he grabs various toys - mainly any West Paw toys I have laying on the ground in my yard, then he and my dog begin a game of chase/keep away with each other. It is hilarious, and my neighbor dog always tries taking the West Paw toys with him when it's time to go home. My dog really enjoys playing fetch, tug, and keep away with this toy, among others from this brand. I like that they have different styles based on their chewing habits.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Maybe I misunderstood the description, I thought would last longer for moderate chewer-it was destroyed the same day it was given to our dog. I will only purchase for extremely aggressive chewer from now on.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have a 1 year old pit mix and he can chew through anything. I’ve had this toy for almost a year now and it was the best money I’ve ever spent!! He plays tug of war with it every day, sits and chews on it for hours, and it’s great for fetch. Has not broken even with extremely rough play. West paw continues to impress me, but this is by far the best toy they have created! I’ve tried many heavy duty toys and none have compared to this.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This toy is my dog’s most favorite toy. He enjoys playing fetch with it, but he is also content to tote it around while walking about the house or just chew on it while lounging. He is an avid chewer, but he is not as hard on toys as my other dog. Both of my dogs are fine with these though, and they hold up well. For reference, both of my dogs are medium build. My male dog is a lab mix, and my female dog is a pitt mix.  We have bought other West Paw toys with a lot of success. The first one I purchased was going strong for well over six months until a family member’s golden retriever mix gnawed off one of the ends. My dogs still enjoy that toy though, and it has still held up, even with an end</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Avoid this product. Granted, our GSP is a destructive chewer, but he chomped through this is under 30 minutes, leaving us with two ... well, let's just say \"rudely suggestive\" pieces and leave it at that. It went straight into the trash. Save your money, buy something sturdier.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog Atticus 3 year old rescue Boston Terrier is an avid Chewer. West Paw is a great brand. It gives him a chew challenge yet doesn’t break apart so no danger of him swallowing it. I think they are a bit pricy, but happy to pay for it considering I don’t have to worry about paying the vet for swallowing rubber pieces! He especially loves the long three knob stick in Purple. His favorite of many!</span>,\n",

We play fetch &amp; tug games together, or I just let him chew on this when he doesn't want a bone. And, it looks pretty much the same as the day we bought it.

       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I've bought this particular toy for my tug-o-war lovin' dogs many times and it's usually held up pretty well considering the energy my one particular dog puts into trying to destroy it. Unfortunately, just a day after a bought a new one, the dogs were playing tug-o-war and the rope pulled out because the knot was not big enough. Now I'm left with a ball that is incredibly hard to play with and a rope that the dogs have minimal interest in. This has happened before but not so shortly after receiving it! Why can't they make the knots a little more substantial so that this doesn't happen? I've tried to shove it back through but it's very difficult and it's near impossible to undo and then re-do </span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My girl loves rhe Romp n Roll but only wants the 4.5 size.  I think she likes to carry it in her mouth and can't do that with the bigger sizes which would seem to be more appropriate for a bigger dog.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I bought this toy for my 1 year old Rottweiler (~80 pounds). She loves regular Jolly Balls, but after a couple of weeks of play would rip the handles off of them from swinging them around. This version of the toy is great in that it has a rope through it that she can use to swing the ball around instead of an attached handle that can break off. The ball itself is much more rigid than a straight Jolly Ball, and feels a little heavier, but that doesn't stop her from whipping it around. Highly recommend for larger, strong dogs who like a good game of tug or for dogs who like to roughhouse with big toys.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have an ACD that loves to destroy toys.  This toy is definitely his favorite.  Thank goodness it can withstand his chewing and he grabs the rope to sling it back and forth.  I have to reinforce the knots or with his play he will pull the rope through the ball.  He will retrieve it all day just to have it thrown or kicked just so he can chase it.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 9 month old English Mastiff has torn apart every toy including his three Kong toys.

He loves to run with it and swing it around. It's very entertaining for him. We purchased the purple one and it stays indoors. It's the perfect size and he loves it as much as the red one. It does not deflate even with tiny puncture holes and the rope has held up incredibly well. Would purchase either again.</span>]},\n",

When I unpacked it I was very surprised at how lightweight and flimsy it felt. Unlike the west paw bones which are totally solid, this one is hollow. Of corse the boys (3 yr old chocolate and 4 yr old yellow labs) were out of their minds with excitement. Who wouldn’t be with a new West Paw toy?  Why not I thought. Let’s give it a try. Well it took under 15 minutes for my yellow lab to chew the end clean off it at, which point I had to be the mean Mom and take it away. Very disappointed.</span>,\n",

When we added a new Rhodesian Ridgeback puppy to our family in July, this was the first toy she grabbed (though it was MUCH too big for her at the time). At 10 months she's now over 75lbs. Both dogs adore this toy. I think it's easy to carry, and it's hollow inside - so they can chew and chew and get a satisfying squish, but they can't chew off pieces of it. The pup likes to flip it up in the air and watch it bounce, then pounces on it. And, even with full-on tug-of-war games between a 70lbs pit bull and a 75lbs rigdeback pup, it still looks perfect. Definitely recommend.</span>,\n",

I’ve purchased many of their soft “rowdy” toys and always loved that not only do my dogs love them, but they’re long lasting. Some hard toys either don’t interest my dogs, or break right away, so I’d avoided buying these type west paw toys....boy am I glad I decided to order this one and try it out!!! My 70lb pitbull spent almost an hour trying to chew on this and it still is in PERFECT shape (see picture!!). All 3 of my pups have been playing with this since it arrived. I’ll see how long it lasts, but even lasting 2 days while being constantly chewed on and still in perfect condition is impressive!!!

She’s a chewer for a puppy and this is one of her favorite toys. We have not had any issue with it coming undone or anything. Will buy this again if needed.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I'm not exactly sure what animal the toy my dogs received is.... But it looks like he's been used as a crash test dummy before coming to me. My dogs are happy with it, despite it's appearance and distended knees and weird legs coming out from the bottom and the top... Just not as cute as in the picture is my biggest disappointment. It just looks like random knotted rope.</span>,\n",

I would buy from Mammoth again, but my money's going toward the 3 - 5 knot ropes which last FOREVER. Would not buy this again. Maybe it would be good for a more mild chewer.</span>,\n",

The problem is, after about 30 minutes of play, the squeaker dies and the ball becomes a foamy, wad of rubber and felt. In a mad attempt to get the ball to \"squeak\", he will keep chewing it, until it falls apart and then he shreds it. \n",

      "Toy Reviews: [<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I love the concept of this ball, Day 1 it was extremely squeaky and extremely bouncy and my dogs loved it. We threw it a few times at the park and then put it away. The next day I went to squeak it and it did this. Ripped at the seams. Badly designed. It no longer squeaks or bounces and is basically useless for the extra money I spent on it. My dog didn't even get to chew on it yet, we only played fetch once. Extremely disappointed and if I find out I can get a refund I will. Dont waste your time or money with this. Find another brand.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This ball was less than $3 and has lasted longer than any other ball we've purchased in the last two years. Absolutely worth the investment. We have a Texas Heeler who annihilates every other toy within a week. This one has lasted over two months and you can hardly tell its been used. Got both the small and large versions and am buying more to stock up in case they ever discontinue them. But I don't even see us needing to replace them anytime soon.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My greyhound loved this for exactly 25 minutes. Then the squeaker stopped working. The surface of the ball is  very tough and it bounces well.\n",

      "Toy Reviews: [<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My Rottweiler loves his squeakies, and I thought this would last longer than it did. There are no punctures or tears showing on the ball, but the squeakie died after a particularly enthusiastic squeaking session. I can barely squish this ball with my hand, so it's pretty strong; I don't know if the squeakie got mooshed just the right way to stop it from working or what, since I see no damage on the outside. Oh well. Back to the drawing board for Rottie-proof squeaky toys. Sigh.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This was a fun toy for a couple of minutes. I thought with it being larger it would be more durable. But our bully breed foster chewed it apart in less than 30 minutes.  I don't necessarily blame the ball as much as I blame our dog.  For fetch this is probably fine, but any chewer, pass.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I can't understand how these have such good reviews.  We bought many packs of these because our dog loves playing with them, but the squeak stops after 15 to 20 minutes of play.  The plus is that they work with the chuckit's and that's about it.  \n",

      "Our dog will squeak the ball a couple of times when he's running it back to me and then drops it, so it's not like he being overly aggressive with the biting and still they stop working.  We actually had 1 recently that made it to the second day of play (only 15-20 mins session) but stopped working after the first or second throw.  \n",

It wasn’t completely broken, so we shoved a chuckit breathe right ball inside to keep her occupied and she was easily able to break chunks off of this ball and tear it apart. We had to take it away and throw it in the garbage so she didn’t eat any little pieces. Might be good if you have a very gentle dog, but it won’t stand up to tug or any rough play with a 75lb GSD. I won’t order again.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I ordered this because my puppy loves to chew on things and chews through everything that I get him that is made up of some sort of fabric.

Thinking that the medium with the next size I ordered it and it’s so large and heavy, It’s bigger than his head and too much for him to carry he doesn’t like it. So it’s disappointing. Not the toys fault, it’s my fault that I wasted the money because he can’t play with it Because it’s too heavy for him to pick up. He’s a king Charles spaniel</span>\n",

I got this in a large as I didn't want to have to constantly rescue it from under the couch or other furniture. I've had this for 1 1/2 months and so far it has stood up wonderfully to his chewing on it and can withstand our vigorous games of tug-of-war (for \"drop-it\" training). It still looks like new.

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Puppies seem to like big toys and this one is big but lightweight (Ihave the medium size).

Toss it in the kiddie pool and they clamber in and pull it out.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 95 lb lab loves his ball. He is not an agressive chewer, so I can't attest to the longevity for a heavy chewer.

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This is my dog’s favorite toy. The ball is durable for a 70 lb standard poodle who wants to play ball 24/7 and even naps with his balls.

This was a replacement for one of his balls that has finally broken after 2 1/2 years because of playing tug-of-war with it, but he still plays with the broken one.</span>\n",

Unfortunately I cannot recommend this unless your dog isn’t a chewer or smart enough to figure out how to pull with her paws and bite/chew at the same time to get the treats out.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Puppies seem to like big toys and this one is big but lightweight (Ihave the medium size). Perfect for introducing my little fosters to fetch but the design also lends itself to tug. I curl one finger thru it and the pup will tug and tug. Toss it in the kiddie pool and they clamber in and pull it out.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 95 lb lab loves his ball. He is not an agressive chewer, so I can't attest to the longevity for a heavy chewer. Griffin likes to shake and chase it and roll around on it. This is actually my second ball since the first one was finally breaking apart after about 5 years of abuse.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This is my dog’s favorite toy. The ball is durable for a 70 lb standard poodle who wants to play ball 24/7 and even naps with his balls. It can easily be carried and caught in his mouth. In fact, my dog will carry two of them in his mouth at a time.  It is easy to grasp and throw for a game of fetch, even with dog slobber. This was a replacement for one of his balls that has finally broken after 2 1/2 years because of playing tug-of-war with it, but he still plays with the broken one.</span>]\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">The rope inside is NYLON not cotton. It lasted less than 5 minutes of play before he started chewing through it, and we had to cut out the rope.

Plus it says good for tug of was but the ropes so thin you can't hold onto it, it cuts into your skin. I bought it cause theres a grocery store about 5mins from my house that has a few dog toys that they sell for. 88cents &amp; there's one that has a tennis ball on it &amp; she loved it but it came apart I assumed it was cause it was so cheap. But it lasted longer than this.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog ripped through the plastic-like rope in 3 minutes. I vacuumed the pieces and we moved on. The ball is still in great shape though. Good toy for dogs who just want to fetch and retrieve. Not good for any amount of chewing.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I ordered several items for my dog's birthday.  She had the rope on this one destroyed in 1 minute.   Had to throw the entire toy in the trash,  so I didn't have to worry about her swallowing the rope strings.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Bad stuff my lab pup tore off the rope in 45 min he  almost swallowed the Rope not very tough and sturdy would say it’s good  the ball is way too small and the rope is too Thin not a good investment</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog likes this toy a lot, however it's not a very well designed tug toy! Major rope burn happens when you try to pull. The knot on the end isn't big enough to be a good grip.</span>\n",

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">The rope is nylon and shredded in minutes. Thin and cheap and not made to last. The ball is fine, but I didn't buy just a ball, did I? Very disappointing.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Throat came untied within 10 minutes and due to the type of rope it is not easily inserted back inside the ball. I would not recommend this and I would not buy it again</span>\n",

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This is hands down my rescue dog’s favorite ball. She lost her first one but our local pet store didn’t have a large Chuck It Ultra so I tried tennis balls but those got destroyed within a day, and other rubber balls just didn’t make her as happy as her Chuck It did! Thankfully Chewy had a really good deal on Large Chuck It balls so I FINALLY got one. My dog was ECSTATIC! She would play and play and play until she is desperate for water! I am not sure if it’s the orange color or the fact that it’s hollow and she can squeeze it but it’s her absolute favorite. Thank you Chuck It and thank you Chewy for making my dog happy!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We have a GSD-Malinois mix who is VERY VERY chewy. HE LOVES the XL Ultra and I love that a month later it hasn't fallen apart! No matter how he bites it, it shows no signs of wear. My only complaint is that it gets VERY slippery with slobber when we are playing ball so I have to keep a bandana onhand! Bounces really well on (hard) grass and other surfaces and the orange color means we find it in the weeds. I've ordered more in case we lose it, not because it was falling apart. Definitely worth the money!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I just got my first pit bull (3yo) about a month ago. She had a regular sized Chuckit! ball when she moved in, but my Boston Terrier kept stealing it so I thought I'd get some bigger ones. I also decided to get some other toys to keep the PB from getting bored.\n",

      "This dog has chewed through 4 rope toys, and 2 stuffed toys. She's demolished one of those tire toys. I'm afraid to get her a Kong because I might just cry when she rips it to shreds in 4 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chuckit! balls, on the other hand, have survived. She lays on the floor and chews them like they were gum, but they just bounce right back! She hasn't managed to destroy a single one of the three!\n",
      "\n",
      "When</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have 7 golden retrievers.  Chuck it rubber type balls are the only balls they will use.  It’s to bad that the Chuckit throwers don’t come with these higher end balls.  My dogs won’t touch the orange and blue tennis type balls that come with the Chuckit throwers.  They run after the tennis type balls but when they get to them they sniff them and just walk away- I have  to retrieve them.  So, now the tennis material balls go straight to the trash.  Such a waste of resources.  For the price, Chuckit should provide these higher in balls that last longer, are much less apt to be  destroyed and swallowed in pieces and are more sanitary.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Chuckit makes the best fetch balls. My GSD loves squeaky ones, but she likes this one too. They bounce better than tennis balls and are much much more durable. They last a long time. Definitely worth the cost. They’re easy to rinse off and clean up, unlike tennis balls. My dog likes to drop her balls in her water bowl when we take a break and these don’t need to be dried out for days like tennis balls.</span>\n",

      "Toy Reviews: [<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This is hands down my rescue dog’s favorite ball. She lost her first one but our local pet store didn’t have a large Chuck It Ultra so I tried tennis balls but those got destroyed within a day, and other rubber balls just didn’t make her as happy as her Chuck It did! Thankfully Chewy had a really good deal on Large Chuck It balls so I FINALLY got one. My dog was ECSTATIC! She would play and play and play until she is desperate for water! I am not sure if it’s the orange color or the fact that it’s hollow and she can squeeze it but it’s her absolute favorite. Thank you Chuck It and thank you Chewy for making my dog happy!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We have a GSD-Malinois mix who is VERY VERY chewy. HE LOVES the XL Ultra and I love that a month later it hasn't fallen apart! No matter how he bites it, it shows no signs of wear. My only complaint is that it gets VERY slippery with slobber when we are playing ball so I have to keep a bandana onhand! Bounces really well on (hard) grass and other surfaces and the orange color means we find it in the weeds. I've ordered more in case we lose it, not because it was falling apart. Definitely worth the money!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I just got my first pit bull (3yo) about a month ago. She had a regular sized Chuckit! ball when she moved in, but my Boston Terrier kept stealing it so I thought I'd get some bigger ones. I also decided to get some other toys to keep the PB from getting bored.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shouldn't have bothered.\n",
      "\n",
      "This dog has chewed through 4 rope toys, and 2 stuffed toys. She's demolished one of those tire toys. I'm afraid to get her a Kong because I might just cry when she rips it to shreds in 4 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chuckit! balls, on the other hand, have survived. She lays on the floor and chews them like they were gum, but they just bounce right back! She hasn't managed to destroy a single one of the three!\n",
      "\n",
      "When</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have 7 golden retrievers.  Chuck it rubber type balls are the only balls they will use.  It’s to bad that the Chuckit throwers don’t come with these higher end balls.  My dogs won’t touch the orange and blue tennis type balls that come with the Chuckit throwers.  They run after the tennis type balls but when they get to them they sniff them and just walk away- I have  to retrieve them.  So, now the tennis material balls go straight to the trash.  Such a waste of resources.  For the price, Chuckit should provide these higher in balls that last longer, are much less apt to be  destroyed and swallowed in pieces and are more sanitary.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Chuckit makes the best fetch balls. My GSD loves squeaky ones, but she likes this one too. They bounce better than tennis balls and are much much more durable. They last a long time. Definitely worth the cost. They’re easy to rinse off and clean up, unlike tennis balls. My dog likes to drop her balls in her water bowl when we take a break and these don’t need to be dried out for days like tennis balls.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I bought this product because all the comments said how strong the toy is and how long it lasted.

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog loves this ball! She loves being able to chew on it. She is a 6.5 year old 18 lb Boston Terrier and not a power chewer but she is still a chewer. This has been a durable ball for her. This probably would not be the best ball for a strong or power chewer. Our only disappointment is the squeaker broke within the first few days of her playing with it. It is a very affordable toy and worth the small cost to replace it because our pup loves it so much. She likes all her toys but I honestly think this is her favorite. I would recommend and have recommended this ball. I have given this ball to my mother and brother who both have 30lb Australian Shepherds. Both of the Australian Shepherds love</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Yuba LOVES this darn thing. She actually \"found\" this ball 2x before I figured out what it was and ordered it. First, she found one at a lake and would not let it go - sadly we learned it belonged to another dog. When she \"found\" it again at another lake, she took off to play independently with it and would not let me near her to take it away!  The other hoomans did not seem impressed. I went home that day and ordered 2! I remove it after a certain amount of play because the squeaking does get a little annoying... I would also agree with other reviews that the packaging is not great - poorly designed with tiny plastic pieces pierced through the ball.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My Chinese Crested of 19lbs, absolutely loves these squeaky balls. He has small, medium and large. For some reason he loves the large one best, but plays with them all. Funny thing is that the large one has the highest pitch squeal when you squeeze it, and the other two are more normal. The large one sounds like a large bird and even though he has tiny teeth, it takes him longer to pick up the large one and he doesn’t care if it just takes him a few more seconds then picking up the others and he is happy as can be throwing it into the air, chasing it, or just sleeping with them. One of the best toys, for sure.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I make sure I have these balls with me in the house, car, and my pocket when walking. The three I keep in my car are for when we go to a park.  The small balls fit in the \"ChuckIt\" stick for tennis balls.  The one in my pocket is to get my dogs attention when another dog approaches.  The ball squeaks and he responds every time.  I definitely have to have at least three for inside.  I bought some medium and large ones for my friends large golden retriever.  He hoards them and loves them.  My little dog can also pick up the medium balls.  I highly recommend these gems.  I wouldn't want to be without them.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have 110 lb. Bernese Mtn Dog, and this is by far his favorite toy!   It's a big substitute also for chewing on things you don't want chewed.   We play with it in the house and outside.  It has a nice bounce so when I can get it away from him we play fetch and he can catch it on the bounce!   I order one a month because after a few weeks of chewing , water and slobber it deflates a bit and  little foam pieces come out.  I've tried other firmer squeaky balls the same size but none catches his attention over this one!    And so easy with Chewy to come with his auto ship.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Goldie (Akita mix) has plenty of balls but the Hartz Dura Play balls in all sizes are her absolute favorite! It may be because they are bacon scented. They are tough and she loves their squeak and the way they bounce. After dinner, we have to \"play ball\"  and she never gets tired of them. She was a rescued mother dog and it is heart warming to see her have so much fun playing.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">One of my dogs is very mellow and shy.  But once you take this ball out she goes NUTS! It is the only toy we can get her to go crazy about and she will play fetch with it all day.  It is strictly and outside toy in our household because she squeaks it so much!  I highly recommend this toy to anyone!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Not sure why this ball is so better than all others. But my ball obsessed doodle loves it. It is a mess to clean up if he gets to the foam so the second I see a hole it goes in the trash and I order 5 more. When I’m tired I have to hide it. The other reviews are right the squeaker is loud and annoying but it only lasts a few days.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We got our 7-week old lab puppy last week and she absolutely adored this ball! She could only really roll it around and jump on it but now it fits in her mouth. She likes how it smells like bacon and squeaks. She is literally the toughest chewer I've ever met for a pup her age. We tried out the Kong rope toys and within 2 days the squeaker and rope were pulled out and the squirrels head was pulled off. This ball has magically held up (for 1 and a half weeks!) and we'll certainly purchase again!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Lasted about 2 weeks for my staffy pup. Getting the ball out of the packaging was a lousy experience. This is the loudest squeaker i've ever heard, way too loud! There is a layer of foam between two layers of rubber so if the rubber gets punctured, your pup will have access to a \"stuffing\" and that's annoying to clean up and monitor as well.  Did not know it was scented, either. It has a strong odor to it which made it hard to put away and not have my pup sniffing for it.</span>\n",
