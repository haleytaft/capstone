      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our 8 month old, shepherd/mastiff has had this toy, for about 3 weeks. She has hardly done damage to it. When our dog gets bored, she wants to shed things. This toy, with a few reminders, is a good go to. Another, good thing is you don't have to break the bank. In order to find a near indestructible toy, for a heavy bored chewer. I don't want to spend $20+, on something I want my dog you chew on. Then, find out, it's not that \"tough\".</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This is a durable toy they keeps it’s shape even when the dogs are trying to destroy it. I have not had any sharp edges yet but we do get some peace’s broken off as they chew so we watch for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The love the way it feels and gives them a good gripping surface. If you have a medium (50lb) dog I would not go smaller then the  medium and would recommend leaning towards the next size up.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">So I have a retriever puppy, Max, who is 9 months old now. He'd always bring in sticks from the backyard that had fallen from the tress (sometimes big ones, don't ask me how he got them through both dog doors...). But now he plays with these instead of bringing in sticks from outside and shredding the pieces around the house. Even our other dog Iris, who is extremely picky about toys and will only play with Antlers with marrow, plays with these and gnaws on them happily. Even better there's no mess to clean up, no splinters or broken off pieces, the toy wears evenly/smoothly as both my pups gnaw away at them.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">The two dogs that visit my house regularly love these sticks. The only complaint I have is that it leaves hard little bits that I have to clean up after every chew session. i will add that I have to clean up after every rope toy or other material is played with as well. They are super aggressive chewers.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our dogs both chew on sticks like it's going out of style, but we didn't want to encourage that, especially in the house. We got them each one of the dogwood tough toys and they LOVE them!! They typically choose these over a normal Nylabone. If you have a chewer I would highly recommend this product!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I am absolutely amazed with how this has held up. It's soft enough for her to make Knicks with her teeth, but hard enough for her to not bite any pieces off and eat it, or for it to break. \n",

      "I have a Shiba Inu (8 month old, 20lbs). She is not rough with her toys in playing, but she is a rough CHEWER. She will sit for hours on any toy and just find areas that she can bite off like parts sewn/stitched together (ears, eyes, feet of toys), undoing ropes, etc.. \n",

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Got this when my dog was smaller and it stopped him from bringing sticks inside. He’s had the same one for over a year until I just threw it away. 10/10 recommend, I’ll be purchasing another one really soon.

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I first tried these on the recommendation of an employee of a pet store. My lab/terrier mix would actually  chew through small sapplings in my yard in order to get sticks for his chewing obsession.  He loves these.

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 6 month old goldendoodle likes to chew, but she’s never ruined even stuffed animals. And yet... she’s been chewing on the dogwood for less than 10 minutes and it’s already starting to flake. I’m worried about her eating too much of it so I’ll have to take it away soon, which is a bummer because a. It’s more expensive than a beef tendon and lasts even less time, b. she really likes it, and c. I literally gave it to her 8 minutes ago. Thought this could help cut on some tendon/bully stick expenses and calories. What a shame. Also, it’s almost too heavy for her to carry.</span>\n",

Tho nothing is dog proof this stuff held up much much longer than any other brand !! The squirrel flyer etc were shredded right off but these huge balls , rollers etc he has taken care of- I’d given this away to my next  door neighbors dog who adored it !

       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My pup is OBSESSED with this thing.  As a fetch and tug addict, it is absolutely perfect for her.  I first found one at TJMaxx and she played with it for many months, maybe even a year, before she managed to dismantle it (which is pretty impressive, given that she can destroy a stuffed animal in less than 10 minutes).  I was so happy to find it on Chewy!  Unfortunately, the seams on the one I ordered started to rip in just a couple of hours and after few weeks it is completely trashed.  Hoping that I just received a defective product?  I'm back here ordering another one (lol) and keeping my fingers crossed!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This toy is of high quality, similar to the other Chuckit! products. This toy was much larger than I pictured it being and is a little challenging/awkward to throw. I have a 62 pound dog and his front leg has gone through the hole when catching it--I'm not super worried about him getting hurt playing with this but it's not out of the picture. He doesn't seem to mind and wants to play with it often!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have never felt the need/desire to write a review on a dog toy before. Well, this toy has made my almost one year old, Belgian Tervuren the happiest dog ever! He is constantly bringing me this toy to throw for him, to fetch, all day long. There are those few moments when he'll kind of share it with his German Shepard sister, and play tug of war. She is seldom allowed to play with it alone. I have never seen him so in love with a toy before. It seems very well made to withstand all of his abuse. Thank you so much for making this toy!!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We have two 3 yr old lab mix dogs that are discovering how much they love the lake and the ChuckIt wheel has been a god send. Its easy for them to see and track, easy for them to retrieve and really floats great! I gave it 4 stars because we haven't had it very long, so can't speak on durability just yet! But anyone with young retrievers... GREAT WATER TOY!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog LOVED this thing! He’s a heavy chewer and this lasted us about 3 months. Usually our toys last from 2mins-2 weeks. \n",

       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I had the smaller one of these before and it lasted for over a year. My second order I got the bigger one.  My dog loves to play rough with this toy and catch it in the air. Very durable, long lasting toy for hours of play.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This product is totally amazing.  We got in April 19 and it has been used daily by out lab/pit and he loves it.  It is easy for them to toss themselves and good to chew on.  We just ordered more to have on hand.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My super chewer boy loves his new wheel. However, even under supervised play he has the lining frayed. Wish it was a bit more durable. But, I will purchase another as he absolutely loves this wheel!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I'm a huge fan of triflyers and since All Kind Toss was out of stock I tried this toy, hoping it would roll and she could chase it. She refuses to retrieve it. I think that one, it doesn't have much weight so it doesn't fly far at all, and two, it is so awkward for her to pick up.</span>]},\n",

Had to take him to the vet because the rope didn't pass through him without help!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our 8 month puppy is completely into demolishing his toys right now. He’s really exercising his jaws and teeth. So I don’t expect toys to last too long. I did think this rope toy would last longer than an hour. He found the weakness in a side seam and the toy was beyond repair. We still let him play with it but had to remove any stuffing. I think it’s a great toy if your pup wants to play tug of war and isn’t so much into tug and  destroy.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I buy and endorse Kong toys on a regular basis, but this one was a disappointment.  The tug ropes on each end are too small for an adult hand to hang onto,  The squeaker is a HUGE disappointment.  It is located in just one of the legs and very hard to find.  It barely squeaked.  The inside of the toy is rope like the handles, but it's not a chew toy, so I'm confused.  It was a gift for a friend's new puppy - he didn't seem intrigued.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">we received this as a gift to our new puppy who’s 9mo. It broke within ten seconds of her playing with it. The ropes completely tore apart and our puppy was eating them within a blink of an eye—I’m not kidding. I wish I was. I’ve never seen a dog toy rip apart so easily. Our puppy is 50lbs and not a very aggressive chewer so it was quite startling to have the toy completely break and fall apart within seconds of having it. I had to cut the rope part off just so she could still remotely play with it since she was starting to try to eat the torn rope ends. I would not recommend this toy unless your dog literally does chew at all.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Both my 80+ lb boxer dogs love this toy. They play tug a war. It has held up well and this is my second one of this style, the other was a monkey I bought quite a while ago, he is still surviving.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">It is recommended as a tough chew toy, but my dogs had both the fluff and the rope ends pulled out within an hour. Very disappointed.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Archie was able to completely deconstruct this thing rather quickly; even the tug o’ war element. I realize nothing lasts forever, especially when given to a 80lb monster with jaws of steel. However, the people at Kong are wacky if they think this product is a deal at nearly $20. Not the worst, but certainly not a house favorite.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We thought we’d give Kong tuggerknots toys a try, as they have a good reputation for quality. Our Airedales love to play with relatively soft toys, especially with a squeaker, but they have a knack for chewing off the fabric. I wish Kong would make a plush like toy for dogs who need to use the black Kong for biting (they can destroy the red ones). Still on the hunt for the elusive perfect plush toy for hard chewers.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog peeled the felt off of the middle in a matter of minutes.  I was surprised because Kong toys usually last longer.  I ended up throwing it away.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I purchased this in the hopes that my Staffy mix, who only has half his teeth, would be able to have a longer lasting tug toy. He definitely did love this toy as promised but had it destroyed within 2 hours. The handles knawed apart and the inner rope exposed. He had a great time with the toy, it's just not as long lasting as claimed.</span>]},\n",

It does eventually look rather ragged and I trim some of the strings. They like to pull on them and grab the squeaky middle toy. They do not have any issue concerning eating of the stringy parts.

Then one of them finally achieved their goal of destruction and chewed off the end. But it lasted a good 4-5 hours! I would highly recommend this toy for almost any other dog.

She untied the knots at both ends right away and chews on the strings on the ends now, which I keep cutting shorter. She also loves the soft tire to chew on and hasn't chewed into it after a month, which is really good.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I thought that I would get the same toy as his previous toy.  The new mammoth Large  tire biter Is only 6” in diameter and the old large size was 10” in diameter.  This old toy lasted several months, but is starting to get chewed up and I wanted to get him a new one.  I’m not sure if the smaller one will last very long.  My dog is a 90 pound lab that is a power chewer.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This toy is good for small animals but not for a Mini Bull terrier. It only lasted 10 minutes with my dog. I would not buy again but I think it is OK for other breeds</span>,\n",

       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We have two larger dogs who are both powerful chewers.  Once again, I tried to find something that would hold their interest for more than a minute.  I thought with this having rope and a tire, that it would be a hit - but I was wrong.  Oh well, on to probably another KONG toy.  Thanks, Chewy!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">If you want your dog to chew rope and swallow it and be able to tear apart then get it. My dog went through the rope immediately and not thinking saw him throw up rope particles, not fun. Cut the rope out and gave my chewer the tire which is indestructible and he had a blast with it. Still able to play tug of war with his sister and play with on his own. The rope part is just awful. I say just buy the tire part and get them excited about it and it will be their next great toy.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">The last tire toy was purchased in 2017 and rope has begun to fray. So, this was purchased and Blossom really likes it. It is narrower in the middle but wider across the tire. Don't think she can put her nose through it like she does with the other (of course growling also!!). Hope it lasts as long a the medium tire.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This item is poorly sized. I have a big boxer that goes through these tires monthly. Usually get them from Menards. Thought this would be easier. It was not. This is a small, not a large toy. I need the tire to be about 10 inches, this size is the rope and tire combined. Very disappointed.</span>,\n",

       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I bought this for my tug-of-war loving pitbull mix. She is a dedicated chewer so I was hoping this toy would be durable enough to last longer than her other toys. This toy lasted about 3 weeks before the rope untied and fell through the tire. Now, she has no interest in the durable tire and only wants to play tug with the rope that has now fallen apart even more.</span>]},\n",

My male dog is a lab mix, and my female dog is a pitt mix.  We have bought other West Paw toys with a lot of success.

Unfortunately, just a day after a bought a new one, the dogs were playing tug-o-war and the rope pulled out because the knot was not big enough. Now I'm left with a ball that is incredibly hard to play with and a rope that the dogs have minimal interest in. This has happened before but not so shortly after receiving it! Why can't they make the knots a little more substantial so that this doesn't happen?

She loves regular Jolly Balls, but after a couple of weeks of play would rip the handles off of them from swinging them around. This version of the toy is great in that it has a rope through it that she can use to swing the ball around instead of an attached handle that can break off. The ball itself is much more rigid than a straight Jolly Ball, and feels a little heavier, but that doesn't stop her from whipping it around. Highly recommend for larger, strong dogs who like a good game of tug or for dogs who like to roughhouse with big toys.</span>,\n",

Well it took under 15 minutes for my yellow lab to chew the end clean off it at, which point I had to be the mean Mom and take it away. Very disappointed.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Love west paw but this one did not survive long. The S shaped tug of war thing and some of the others are indestructible. And I have a dog that can take down a super Kong in seconds!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My high energy 2 year old pitbull has so much fun with this toy. It's the perfect shape for her to hold onto and play with herself. Entertains her for hours. She's has it for months and it doesn't have any signs of wear.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have a lab that is a power chewer and West Paw (and little else) stands up to the test! When this arrived, I was a little nervous since it was lighter weight and seemed less durable than some of the other West Paw products I had previously purchased. I have been really surprised that there is not even one tooth mark in this toy after more than a month of aggressive fetch, tug, and chewing with the toy! I actually like that it’s lighter weight when throwing it around with the dog in the house. It’s my dog’s new favorite toy! It’s also great outside and floats! With Chewy’s great customer service and West Paw guarantee, you can’t go wrong! West paw had replaced for free one toy my dog was able</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog loves this toy. She will not play with her other rubber toys unless they are one with food in them. This one she searches for out of her toy basket and entertains herself all day long with. The hallow inner makes a squishing this toy fun. She is an avid chewer and will destroy any toy that isn't durable and this toy is holding up so far.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I bought this a year or so ago for my pit bull, and he still loves it. When we added a new Rhodesian Ridgeback puppy to our family in July, this was the first toy she grabbed (though it was MUCH too big for her at the time). At 10 months she's now over 75lbs. Both dogs adore this toy. I think it's easy to carry, and it's hollow inside - so they can chew and chew and get a satisfying squish, but they can't chew off pieces of it. The pup likes to flip it up in the air and watch it bounce, then pounces on it. And, even with full-on tug-of-war games between a 70lbs pit bull and a 75lbs rigdeback pup, it still looks perfect. Definitely recommend.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Once again West Paw has impressed me. I’ve purchased many of their soft “rowdy” toys and always loved that not only do my dogs love them, but they’re long lasting. Some hard toys either don’t interest my dogs, or break right away, so I’d avoided buying these type west paw toys....boy am I glad I decided to order this one and try it out!!! My 70lb pitbull spent almost an hour trying to chew on this and it still is in PERFECT shape (see picture!!). All 3 of my pups have been playing with this since it arrived. I’ll see how long it lasts, but even lasting 2 days while being constantly chewed on and still in perfect condition is impressive!!! I have high hopes and will definitely be ordering more</span>]},\n",

She loves to chase the ball, and LOVES to play tug-of-war with it when she brings it back to us. The size was perfect for her (6-inch size, 60 pound Pointer), and the ball held up well against her abuse. The rope was destroyed after about an hour or two of playtime, but we expected as much, as our dog is known to destroy her toys with great relish. I can see myself buying this toy in future summers, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a good backyard toy!</span>,\n",

It’s actually such poor quality that I wonder if it’s not even the real jolly brand!</span>,\n",

It’s survived a week of tugging and tossing between a variety of different breeds &amp; sizes from pit bull mixes to a Jack Russel. It’s of good quality and should last a couple of months at least. Definitely will be getting more in the future. The price is nice as well. The big box pet stores sell this brand at double to triple the Chewy.com price.</span>,\n",

This is the longest lasting toy in our house next to a Kong extreme. She loves to whip it around and play tug, then at the end of all that excitement she will sit down and chew on the ball for hours. It has so many teeth holes it's incredible and yet it's still is held together firmly with no chunks being taken out.</span>]},\n",

It's great for a game of toss and fetch and you can even soak it in water and freeze it for an extra cool toy during the hot summer months, or for teething puppies.\",\n",

He shredded the tail in the first 2 minutes. The trunk took a week to shred. And the body is holding up really well. The 2 dogs tug with it and it's chewed on daily. It's survived my boys for almost 3 weeks now - amazing! LOL!</span>,\n",
