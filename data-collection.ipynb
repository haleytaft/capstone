I'm not sure how many I've purchased but I keep buying them when they start to break because my pup (who is now a 14 month old 50 lb chinese shar pei) loves this and who am I to say no? so, yes, I know it's for teethers, but my lil' guy said he's still teething and to give him his binky back.</span>\n",

I'm not sure how many I've purchased but I keep buying them when they start to break because my pup (who is now a 14 month old 50 lb chinese shar pei) loves this and who am I to say no? so, yes, I know it's for teethers, but my lil' guy said he's still teething and to give him his binky back.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">These keys are just right for puppies with biting/teething issues. The keys give them something to help wean the teething process in an hopefully save your skin from bleeding as much from Sharp puppy teeth. In the end these keys are Awesome toy for your fur baby</span>]\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have had dozens of dogs over the years, and raising puppies has definitely been a lot easier with the addition of Kongs! There are so many different flavors of both liquid/paste based treats and solid treats that you can purchase for your pups, you're sure to find a flavor every dog will enjoy. Also, if you're on a budget, you can simply buy some peanut butter and spread it around the inside with a kitchen knife. Saves your house from teething destruction and they are also the best tool I have found for separation anxiety. Even my adult dogs get one right before I leave the house, and they don't even care that I'm leaving.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Just got this today and I know it's goofy to write a review right away about an item/purchase BUT(!) I tested it out as soon as I got home with my dog - he's usually iffy about toys or anything that is NOT food... I filled it with the cheese &amp; Bacon spray and he just went to town! Absolutely loves it. I've been thinking about getting one of these for a while but finally gave in and happy I did!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This is the perfect size for a puppy.  Only complaint was I ordered pink and received blue.  Puppy didn't mind but the owner gave me a hard time (jokingly).  Puppy loved it and it does keep her entertained when owner needs quiet time.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Smaller than I expected and I ordered a size bigger than what I was expecting. Other than that it’s good, my dog likes it as a treat.\n",

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Even as a puppy, my dog was quite a chewer. And, as most puppies do, she had absolute razor-blade teeth.

Before it was damaged, it was really useful to cram full of peanut butter and freeze for her to get out when she was having separation anxiety.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">It doesn't save the fingers and hands from sharp tiny milk teeth but, Yellow Dog loves to toss it around and make it bounce and chase after it and chew on it, lol! So energy outlet wise it is a great toy from puppies!!! :D</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Finally, a really tiny chew toy for my Pug puppy.  She will actually be able to grab it and it is indeed softer than the standard Kong,  I ordered the small as well because she may grow out of this tiny XSmall one quickly but it is the perfect starter!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This is his favorite Kong. We ordered it in blue (for a boy) . Although, when I called customer service to request the blue one, they told me they can not guarantee the color that will come. It DID arrive in blue!!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My Chihuahua/Pug mixed babies are massive chewers. Most of the items I give to them are destroyed in a few hours (or less). They love the challenge of getting their treats, and they are easily cleaned and sanitized. Hooray for me AND my babies!!!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This puppy kong is easy for my 12 lb girl to carry around and chew. I wish it was a bit shorter because she can't get the squeeze cheese or peanut butter and the end of the treat. It's really difficult to clean, but I will keep using it because it holds treats well and she loves it!</span>\n",

It's very well made and good quality, so I upped my review from 3-stars to 4 because it's not the company's fault my dogs are picky about the wood they chew. From my dogs' behaviors, I'd bet that this toy tastes like wood. (I did not taste this toy.) I'm satisfied with the purchase, not sure if it's for everyone.

It’s more expensive than a beef tendon and lasts even less time, b. she really likes it, and c. I literally gave it to her 8 minutes ago.

Even our other dog Iris, who is extremely picky about toys and will only play with Antlers with marrow, plays with these and gnaws on them happily.

The large size is perfect for her to grab tight with her legs and chew till her her heart's content.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I bought this cause I have an 8mth old Rottweiler who has teeth still coming in in the back. This was actually the first one I had came across that said Souper &amp; wolf for some reason I thought that was make them tougher. &amp; She absolutely loves sticks so I thought this wld be perfect. She did choose it over another bone that I had but it had pieces coming off of it in less than a day or two. To make sure she's not swallowing &amp; gets hurt I had to take it away from her. I knew there wld be ware &amp; tare I just didn't expect it to be so early.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This particular item lasted less than 30 seconds out of the box before it was in chunks on the floor and had to be thrown away.  \n",

He loves these!!! This is the third one i've bought in about 4 months. They don't stink, splinter, or leave a mess.

Longest he's sat in one place with a toy before. We've had it for 4 days and each morning he goes to look for it. The 3 level chubby kong and other toys are abandoned, he is going for this. I stick a treat in it once in a while and he has to really work to get it out- he loves it. Easy to carry around, not too heavy, and he can chew to his heart's content.

This Wobbler makes meal time last for 10-15 mins. What's not to love? I pick it up when he's not eating. Not an appropriate chew toy. It still looks like new, way easier to clean than traditional Kong's, which I also have several of. They all have their uses.</span>\n",

We got the large one for our sheepadoodle puppy and it took him a little while to figure it out. Although when he did it only took him a few minutes to clear it out. We feed him lunch in it most days to get some of his energy out and he loves it. If you have a smart dog as soon as they learn how it works it won’t take much. I’d give it 5 stars if it took him longer to clean out, maybe when we switch to adult dog food where the pieces are a little bigger.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 50lb Catahoula girl absolutely loves it! She is crazy about food, and can eat all of her food from a slow feeder bowl in under two minutes. With this, it takes her about 15 minutes to completely empty it. She has more difficult food/treat dispensing toys but that take her longer, but I like that I can fit her whole meal in this and not have to refill it. Heavy chewers should not be left alone with it though. she doesn't chew on it other than to pick it up and move it, and after a week the top is pretty cut up. It'd be easy for her to take a chunk out of the plastic if she wanted to.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Keeps my crazy lab busy during breakfast and dinner. I usually split his kibble portion in half in his slow feeder and feed him in his wobbler kong outside to keep him busy. The kong is huge so if you have a big dog, get the large. My lab thought this was a toy and started to chew on the top, but eventually figured out that it dispenses treats/kibble. It's entertaining watching him use his nose and paws to get the treats out of the toy. Definitely would recommend this to prolong feeding times and also keep you pup mentally and physically stimulated.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This is my third slow feeder, and I actually love this one (and so does my pup). All the martial is a hard plastic and the bottom screws off for easy, thorough cleaning. The opening in the side is large enough for the large pieces of kibble to easily fall out without getting jammed, but still requiresb our pup to put in some effort to get his food.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our big boy figured this toy out quickly and can’t get enough of it! It’s larger than I expected but I don’t mind and neither does he. We get a larger kibble so usually only 3-4 pieces max fall out at once, which slows mealtime down nicely. He doesn’t give up till he’s got every bit out. It’s a pretty firm plastic, unlike most kong chew toy types, but there’s no edge for him to really try and chew except for the hole for the treats. He hasn’t been able to break it and he’s a power chewer.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This unscrews to place the treats inside. We had one years ago and our dogs ignored it. Not so with our newest Dane/Mastiff.

      "Toy Reviews: [<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have a 3 month old mini goldendoodle who loves this Wobbler. I didn't use until this week because he didn't seem to \"get it\" a few weeks back. He was scared at first but I showed him that making it tip and spin will award him with one piece or jackpot of kibble! He's still a pup so his meals are only 1/4-1/3 cup each. This Wobbler makes meal time last for 10-15 mins. What's not to love? I pick it up when he's not eating. Not an appropriate chew toy. It still looks like new, way easier to clean than traditional Kong's, which I also have several of. They all have their uses.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I’ve used this for 3 months \n",

      "My Aussie/heeler outsmarts or destroys most of the “interactive toys” much to my wallet’s dismay. The last food ball I bought she would roll around her bolster bed instead of the floor. With her other food toys she’ll hold them and unscrew them. \n",
      "\n",
      "This toy has officially outworked her. SCORE!\n",
      "\n",
      "The toy is bottom heavy making it easy to fill and making the dog actually work for the food. They have to bobble or push it to get any food. It is made of a plastic that is hard and durable but not brittle. \n",
      "\n",
      "This toy is not obnoxiously loud on hard floors like many others. (If your dog can throw it</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I wanted to give it 5 stars. It is a great products and perfect for a busy dog. We got the large one for our sheepadoodle puppy and it took him a little while to figure it out. Although when he did it only took him a few minutes to clear it out. We feed him lunch in it most days to get some of his energy out and he loves it. If you have a smart dog as soon as they learn how it works it won’t take much. I’d give it 5 stars if it took him longer to clean out, maybe when we switch to adult dog food where the pieces are a little bigger.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 50lb Catahoula girl absolutely loves it! She is crazy about food, and can eat all of her food from a slow feeder bowl in under two minutes. With this, it takes her about 15 minutes to completely empty it. She has more difficult food/treat dispensing toys but that take her longer, but I like that I can fit her whole meal in this and not have to refill it. Heavy chewers should not be left alone with it though. she doesn't chew on it other than to pick it up and move it, and after a week the top is pretty cut up. It'd be easy for her to take a chunk out of the plastic if she wanted to.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Keeps my crazy lab busy during breakfast and dinner. I usually split his kibble portion in half in his slow feeder and feed him in his wobbler kong outside to keep him busy. The kong is huge so if you have a big dog, get the large. My lab thought this was a toy and started to chew on the top, but eventually figured out that it dispenses treats/kibble. It's entertaining watching him use his nose and paws to get the treats out of the toy. Definitely would recommend this to prolong feeding times and also keep you pup mentally and physically stimulated.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This is my third slow feeder, and I actually love this one (and so does my pup). All the martial is a hard plastic and the bottom screws off for easy, thorough cleaning. The opening in the side is large enough for the large pieces of kibble to easily fall out without getting jammed, but still requiresb our pup to put in some effort to get his food.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our big boy figured this toy out quickly and can’t get enough of it! It’s larger than I expected but I don’t mind and neither does he. We get a larger kibble so usually only 3-4 pieces max fall out at once, which slows mealtime down nicely. He doesn’t give up till he’s got every bit out. It’s a pretty firm plastic, unlike most kong chew toy types, but there’s no edge for him to really try and chew except for the hole for the treats. He hasn’t been able to break it and he’s a power chewer.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This unscrews to place the treats inside. We had one years ago and our dogs ignored it. Not so with our newest Dane/Mastiff. Not only is she occupied for long periods with this, but she manages to get it unscrewed no matter how tight we screw it together. A true joy to watch her struggles.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This Kong is awesome! When you need some time to decompress after a long day,  this toy will keep you baby busy!

I recommend this to anyone who needs their fur babies to be occupied for a longer period of time.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Ordered for a local rescue that had a transfer of 13 puppies to Minnesota from the south. This was on their wish list. My order was delivered directly to the rescue:  Win-Win. I hear that the puppies are thriving.

They have lasted longer than most of the toys !</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My pitty mix has been chewing on this bone for two weeks, the first one ever to last this long!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Rottweiler wasnt interested in this bone at all. Would not purchase this again.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog loves anything bacon flavored. This particular chew keeps him busy for hours. Huge fan of this company &amp; all their chews &amp; toys. so many flavors &amp; different types of chews to choose from. We highly recommend</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our standard poodle absolutely loves this bone! We received it in our Bullymake subscription box (for power chewers) and she immediately took to it. We have since purchased a second, only because and some point she'd chewed it so much that the edges were very sharp and too much debris had collected. It lasted a good 6+ months with hours and hours of entertainment.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Great bone for an aggressive chewer. Over a month and just a little rough around the edges. Keeps him away from chewing other things and entertained for hours at a time.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog likes this bone. She doesn't go crazy for it, but if it's the only chew toy in her grasp she goes for it.  I haven't had any issues with her chewing it so bad that it breaks apart or anything.</span>]\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog likes to chew on this bone, but it is very hard.  I know it says it's nylon, but it feels like hard plastic.  I have always heard that you should be able to put your fingernail into any type of bone you give your dog or risk them cracking a tooth.</span>\n",

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">He didn't really care for this, I probably got to big of one, so I tried giving it to our 70 lb dog, but she wasn't interested either, not sure why. It doesn't smell bad.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My Portugese Water Dog puppy LOVES this bone. It is the only toy that has lasted and it takes such a beating. I would 100% but again, but don’t actually know if I’ll ever need to!</span>\n",

Bone will last for a long time</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">All my dogs like to chew and one, even though her gums are sensitive and will bleed even from puppy chews, she only wants hard chew toys. However with this toy and others from this brand she never had an issue no matter how rough it gets and they don't flake off as bad as nylabone. the smell is strong but not in a bad way. Im sticking to this brand for awhile</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This bone has been the toy of choice for my lab/American bulldog mix for the past two weeks. It has just enough smell and flavor to keep her interested. It stays intact while she gnaws away at it.  This was definitely a good choice and I would purchase again.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog is. a chewer and she had no interest beyond a quick sniff of the toy</span>]\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I bought these based on the price. They looked to be the same as benebones but different shapes and less expensive. The smallest bone that looks like a stick smells really strong and my dogs steal it from one another all the time. I have had them for a few months now, and they have been a great set so far!</span>\n",

It felt like the same material as the Skamp so I'm not sure why he was able to get a piece off so easy on the ZogoFlex. I guess I'll just try another Skamp.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Neat toy and the dogies love it. Love the color and is made well.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Right size, weight and design for one year old male shih tzu small mouth.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Dogs enjoy tugging and tossing toy even if its not loaded with treats</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This toy is like a Kong. When you throw it, it bounces all over. My puppy loves to walk around with it in his mouth. It easier for him to carry than a Kong. Good quality rubber so no worries about him chewing it up. Prefer the medium size to twist the legs together. My puppy is 65 lbs. It would be too heavy for a small dog.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My little rescue is a destructive chewer, but this toy really holds up and she loves it so much. Thanks Chewy!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog had this toy not even 5 minutes and cracked it open. I bought the purple echo version and has had it a couple months np. Idk this one didn't hold up which sucks because I was going to buy her one of everything so she had a variety inside and out but now not so sure. Very disappointed!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">These are the best for my super chewer!!  She cant destroy it but it’s still fun and bounces around as she tosses it.  My two girls can also chew on it together making it more fun for them</span>]\n",

However when she got to 6+ months she loved it and could chew on it for a long time! Afterwards we purchased the medium size bone and she loved it too.

I bought it as a gift for my friend's dog and they love it too! My favorite purchase from Chewy by far!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My young Lab has been working his way through a variety of \"tough\" chew toys and bones. Not many last more than a week before they break into pieces and/or wear down and are then too small to be safe. This wishbone (large) was more than I wanted to spend but I figured it was worth a shot, especially if it lasted a few weeks or more. He LOVES it! Initially had some trouble grasping it and getting it to stay upright in his paws but now, 6 days in, he's a pro. He'll actually pick it up and go to his \"place\" without my asking (miracle) to chew it and last night he kept himself occupied for about 1 hour (miracle). Nothing entertains him for that long!

We went to Nylabone since the small, softer one all our  dogs enjoy has seen great service but a little small for  our to be 60# (now 20) Goldendoodle.

They don't seem to be attracted to it as much as other Nylabone chews for some reason though.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My puppies loved this toy. I started to notice little small pieces of plastic the same color of the toy in my floor, where the dogs normally are playing. My puppy threw up and those small pieces of plastic were scatted all throughout it. And there’s been a couple different instances of him crying a little bit while trying to do his business, and upon looking at his you know what, the plastic is everywhere. He’s fine day to day but eating plastic isn’t safe.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Previously bought a 2 pack of Nylabones, they were so hard, I was afraid they would damage our dogs teeth.  We already had to have a cracked tooth extracted.  This looked like it might be a better choice, but was wrong.  Hard like a rock.  We went to Nylabone since the small, softer one all our  dogs enjoy has seen great service but a little small for  our to be 60# (now 20) Goldendoodle.  Since  he has puppy teeth, we let him try this.  He wanted nothing to do with it.  Prefers another brand.  Too bad Nylabone doesn't make larger bones  from the same material as the small ones.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My boxer really loves it. He chews that toy for hours at night. I would caution everyone and that it does get really sharp on the plastic after it get chewed and it can cause him to have a sensitive mouth but he will not let him take it away because he really loves it. I took it away one night and he sat and cried for almost half an hour. I recommend this toy</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 9 month old pitt/ boxer mix loves to chew on just about any and everything. I purchased this in hopes of finding something that would last longer than a bone which he can usually get through in just under an hour. This toy doesn’t smell and keeps him occupied for HOURS. Definitely will repurchase when he’s done with this one.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My youngest, Sgt Hank is quite the chewer and he loves this! I feel it is safer for him than other chew toys. Only thing is, my older 2 love it too and we only have 1.\n",
      "Even my Toy Poodle will steal it from her baby brother and the bone is the size of her!!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog literally LOVES this! This bone will keep her entertained for hours plus it lasts a long time. Best purchase!</span>]\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This has been a hit with my pup as well as all the pups I've puppysat for.

I have very heavy chewers we usually get the BIG Nylabone these in minutes were able to chew a lot off with it being a toy &amp; not a bone I didn't like how much they were ingesting so I tossed it. It would probably be a good toy for a dog that isn't a heavy chewer.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog was afraid of the bone,  not sure if it is the smell of the bone.  Tried putting peanut butter on the end to get him to like it, he did lick the peanut butter off but has not touched it since.  A lot of money for nothing.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Got these so my small dogs would stop chewing chunks of mulch, but they weren’t interested in these at all.

I got the Nylabone durachew shishkabob and funnel cake twin pack in this order, too, and he prefers those, but dogs have individual preferences!  He likes rubbery-feeling toys, but as he literally eats them, I stay away from them. This bone has embossed printing on it so I rub natural peanut butter in the letters to interest him. I’m fairly confident he will eventually chew this like he does his newly discovered enjoyment of the other Nylabone ‘bones’. I feel safe in putting this in his crate with him at night and when I’m gone from home. He’s a 60-ish pound extremely high energy Labrador</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog loves this and it's holding strong. I would recommend this product and would purchase it again.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I ordered this for my best friend’s dog who shreds any toy he has. He loves the flavor and we’re happy he finally had a toy that’ll last.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog was completely uninterested in this toy, which surprised me. But I gave it to my roommate's dog who chewed her heart out! To this day (months later), there are only small teeth marks in it, and she's a medium-sized Australian Shepherd. Very impressed with this toy!</span>]\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I thought this chew toy was really great at first. The peanut smells great, and my dog loved it. After a week or so it got really sharp and my dog insisted on chewing only the single side. I would remove the sharp parts but he was quickly cutting his mouth. This toy is just so weird because your dog needs to be the exact right type of chewer, not too calm, not too aggressive. Before you give this to your dog check the Benebone website. They recommend throwing this chew toy away after only moderate use and replacing it monthly. So many reviewers have pics of this chewed down to the nubs. I would be really careful with this toy.

I saw that this came in his favorite flavor, peanut butter, and knew I had to get it for him. When I first gave it to him, he didn’t give it so much as a second glance. Which is unusual for him as he loves his flavored chew toys. It took me spreading a bit of real peanut butter on this for him to even acknowledge it. Now he loves it.

Does she play/chew for 45 plus minutes</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog loves his bacon benebones more than anything, and after the time was up for his wishbone, I thought i would try out the other shape to see how it would wear and if he liked holding one shape better than the other. I don't know if this shape is thinner, but it is wearing down WAY faster than the wishbone with the same amount of chewing. I am disappointed with this because they aren't cheap, and I do expect them to last at least a month with my pup and I'm not sure if this shape will. In the future I will repurchase the wishbone shape instead.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 65 pound Bernese mix is a very aggressive chewer. It took her more than two weeks to chew through this bone (usually she chews through them in a few days). Highly recommend for durability and overall my dog just loves it!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My golden loves to chew while I'm studying and he loves this toy! It keeps him engaged and its held up after several long sessions. The design lets him prop the toy up easily so he can focus on attempting to destroy it.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I can’t believe this chew toy is still available. It is well known to get stuck on the lower jaw. It happened to my dog and luckily I was able to remove it without using a saw. It went into the garbage. This company has many other excellent options. Don’t buy this one.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog absolutely loves this!! It’s his favorite chew toy, he cannot go to bed with out it!! He’s had one ever since he was a puppy and it’s the only toy he cannot tear up!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog goes back to it almost every day! I needed to buy another because his first one is in rough shape, but it lasted a good while! And he's a CHEWER. Right now he's only 35 lbs, but looks like it would withstand a larger dog no problem.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I bought many bones but this nylon bone my dog and many other dogs I now of love them \n",

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Love this brand &amp; these bones but weren't aware how small these are in particular. I'd say this size is good for dogs up to 20 lbs. Maximum.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">The great thing about this was that it came with 3 bones for my 3 dogs.  The bad thing was that one of my dogs is small and the others are medium.  The size of the nylabone toys was perfect for the smallest of my dogs but a little too small for my bigger ones.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My small dog loves to chew and these are her favorite.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dogs love the \"flavors\" of these bones, but they are smaller than I thought they would be. Maybe the measurements are on the listing and I just never checked. Otherwise we're happy.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">It’s looks more plasticky, feels kind of like a bottle cap texture. My dog loves it. She usually gets bored with the same toy for long but she chews on it non-stop now. Keeps her busy!</span>\n",

Strongly recommend.</span>\n",

I decided to try this and it’s holding up great. Will buy again!!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I bought 3 for my dogs.  They are not interested at all- refuse to chew on them. They sniffed them then walked away.  Will buy other nylabones next time.</span>\n",

They don't have a disagreeable smell and I wash them periodically to get off old dog saliva. We have even lopped off the really gnarly ends when they get too rough to give the bones more life.

As always, use supervision when giving your pet any type of toy/chew bone.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Walden goes crazy over most Nylabones he gets, and this one he took straight from my hand fresh out of the Chewy box and went and gnawed happily for about 15 minutes. The vets always compliment how good his teeth look and I owe a lot of that to Nylabones!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have an English bulldog and she loves the Nylabone chew toy, she's very territorial with it and growls if we go anywhere near her while she's chewing on it, these chew bones hold up very well and keep her busy for hours, I highly recommend this product for dogs who are bored or aggressive chewers</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">As other reviews have said, this bone is ROCK HARD. My dog hasn't damaged his teeth but I'm throwing it out before he can. Also the title says \"original flavored\" but it's very clearly not flavored at all, my dog is bored of it right away (I even licked it to confirm). Absolute garbage  chew toy.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My soon grown pup has been an horendous chewer.  She likes an old Nylabone from dogs long gone, like 20 yrs old.  The other dogs that worked on this bone, although was always a favorite, only got 1/4 of it ground off.  This pup has it down to only the knuckle. The funny thing is, my other dogs ranged from 55 - 98 lbs. This new pup is only 25 lbs.! I tried to find the same bone, but this one was the closest I could find.  She took a couple weeks to decide to chew it, but now is loving it. I don't think it will last  20 years though!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Bone seems tough, like it would last...if my dog would chew it.</span>]\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I love this concept and the treat inside absolutely lasted longer than expected and frustrated the dog. Unfortunately, once our Golden couldn't figure out how to get more treat out, he started ripping on the tire ridges. I was unsurprised, since, when I opened the package, I thought the tire felt soft, but I did find it surprising considering the marketing.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I liked the idea of this toy but my dog didn’t like it. After a a couple days she did eat the treat that came with it. No obvious chewing of the rubber toy though. I replaced the treat and she never touched the toy again. The treat did have a very weird sweet smell to it. I had left the treat in the garage and whenever I went in there I could smell it. My dog literally tries to eat garbage and isn’t picky at all. Maybe some different flavors would be better?</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Not sure why there are so many negative reviews regarding the smell. Not sure if they are talking about the rubber or the treat. I washed the rubber just because thats what I do with new stuff. The rubber nor the treat have an odor. Sometimes my dog is able to work the puck out of the tire but when he doesn't it keeps him busy for hours. I have a size medium for my miniature poodle and a large for my lab mix. This chew works well for us.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Good news:  my dog loved it. Bad news:  he had the treat out of the tire in under 15 minutes and devoured it in another 15 minutes\n",
      "He is an 18 lb dog, and I got the medium (15-40 lbs). So at 150 calories that’s quite a hefty snack.  I thought this would be something he would gnaw on and put aside for later, but nope. The treat part is kind of soft/chewy, not hard. I don’t consider my dog an aggressive chewer but he is highly food motivated. I’ll try the tire with some peanut butter in the grooves, it seems pretty substantial.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Try as I do to find a toy that can live up to its claims, I can’t. The only toy that has lasted so far is the black, extra tough Kongs. My guy had the entire top of the treat gone within 20 minutes. It took him another 40 to begin biting off pieces. He gets so excited to have new toys and though we have to take them away. So that was $$$ wasted! Very disappointed!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">our dogs love this toy/snack. This snack will keep the Dog busy licking and playing with the indestructible rubber tire. It is refillable so it has a long life. Our dogs eat everything. This is still around and still fun for them. Money well spent on dog toys.

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I bought this to replace one I have had for a while. Out of the package it had an overly sweet fake vanilla scent. My dog ate up the treat and enjoyed removing it, however, it made him sick to his stomach. He used to bring me the old one all the time hoping for a treat but he hasn’t touched this one since the first night. The treats have never caused a problem before so I am guessing it was whatever was put on the wheel itself to give that smell. I am disappointed.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This is a great idea for a toy but it didn't work out for us. First of all, it smells really bad and the odor is so strong, it has to stay outside. Like fake vanilla. Some folks might like that but I don't. It's so strong it clings to rugs and surfaces. Yuck. One of my two dogs was interested in it as an outside toy for a while but once the ridges got flattened from licking and chewing, she lost interest. Now it's just a stinky neglected piece of rubber hanging around stinking up my yard. Yup, after being outside for several weeks it just keeps on reeking. Next stop, the trash.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I got this for my bernedoodle. He had it started in pieces within a day. It's now a million tiny pieces. I am only getting toys that say they are \"tough\" but so far, have been sorely disappointed! He's definitely a tough chewer and this did not stand up to his chewing.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Just another toy added to the long list of hundreds of dollars spent on toys. Another toy marketed for extreme chewers that lasted my dog all of 30 minutes before the actual rubber itself was shredded. The treat center held up 15.

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We got this for our Westie at Christmas and she loves to chew on it and have us throw it for her to fetch.  Once in a while I will put a little bit of peanut butter or other soft dog treat on the blue ends for her to lick off.  It takes her at least an hour to get it good and clean.  I wash it before she uses it again with no problems.  I would give 5 stars but the letters are starting to peel off and she likes to worry at them until they do. She hasn't eaten any (that I can tell, they usually end up on the floor) but I will be throwing this one out soon. It has been 9 months so we have gotten a good amount of use out of it. I will be ordering another for her</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This was one of my pups favorite chew toys until the raised bumps started coming off after chewing. Not as tough as a lot of the Kong toys. I will probably order another, it lasted about 3 weeks before my pup was able to chew off the raised bumps. Seems like it would be a good cleaner for their teeth.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I had high hopes for this toy.  Our 17 pound terrier mix is very particular about what she will chew on, but when she chews on something she really works it over.  Isabel had this toy chewed into small pieces within a few short hours.  she broke the first piece off within 60 mins.  She loved it but it just didn't last.  For the cost I was hoping it would last longer than one evening.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Both of my dogs are power chewers, however one is more so than the other. She managed to chew off the ends in no time at all. I found pieces of plastic all over the house and I found the blue rubber with it. I wouldn't recommend for a power chewer. I also wouldn't recommend this for a dog that likes to eat what they chew instead of just chew it. I had to take one of my dogs to the vet and they found a blockage; part of that blockage was caused by this toy. SO IF YOUR DOG EATS WHAT THEY CHEW ON, DO NOT GET THIS!!!!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I've purchased this before and it lasted a very long time, I'm sure it's lost around here somewhere. The one I purchased recently wasn't even close to the 1st one, half of it chewed off in one day. I think maybe the product material changed.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This item was recommended as an extreme dog chew toy.  My labradoodle chewed through this in less than 5 minutes.  She is not even my extreme chewer.  This is a $14 toy and I feel it should have lasted longer than this.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I probably should have read the reviews before I purchased but since it was Kong brand I expected better. My dog had this chewed apart in like 30 mins or less. UGH!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I always have to look for sturdy toys and this one had a little alphabets on it that the dogs were chewing off right from the beginning. Toy lasted 10 minutes</span>\n",

      "Toy Reviews: [<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We got this for our Westie at Christmas and she loves to chew on it and have us throw it for her to fetch.  Once in a while I will put a little bit of peanut butter or other soft dog treat on the blue ends for her to lick off.  It takes her at least an hour to get it good and clean.  I wash it before she uses it again with no problems.  I would give 5 stars but the letters are starting to peel off and she likes to worry at them until they do. She hasn't eaten any (that I can tell, they usually end up on the floor) but I will be throwing this one out soon. It has been 9 months so we have gotten a good amount of use out of it. I will be ordering another for her</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This was one of my pups favorite chew toys until the raised bumps started coming off after chewing. Not as tough as a lot of the Kong toys. I will probably order another, it lasted about 3 weeks before my pup was able to chew off the raised bumps. Seems like it would be a good cleaner for their teeth.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I had high hopes for this toy.  Our 17 pound terrier mix is very particular about what she will chew on, but when she chews on something she really works it over.  Isabel had this toy chewed into small pieces within a few short hours.  she broke the first piece off within 60 mins.  She loved it but it just didn't last.  For the cost I was hoping it would last longer than one evening.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Both of my dogs are power chewers, however one is more so than the other. She managed to chew off the ends in no time at all. I found pieces of plastic all over the house and I found the blue rubber with it. I wouldn't recommend for a power chewer. I also wouldn't recommend this for a dog that likes to eat what they chew instead of just chew it. I had to take one of my dogs to the vet and they found a blockage; part of that blockage was caused by this toy. SO IF YOUR DOG EATS WHAT THEY CHEW ON, DO NOT GET THIS!!!!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I've purchased this before and it lasted a very long time, I'm sure it's lost around here somewhere. The one I purchased recently wasn't even close to the 1st one, half of it chewed off in one day. I think maybe the product material changed.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This item was recommended as an extreme dog chew toy.  My labradoodle chewed through this in less than 5 minutes.  She is not even my extreme chewer.  This is a $14 toy and I feel it should have lasted longer than this.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I probably should have read the reviews before I purchased but since it was Kong brand I expected better. My dog had this chewed apart in like 30 mins or less. UGH!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I always have to look for sturdy toys and this one had a little alphabets on it that the dogs were chewing off right from the beginning. Toy lasted 10 minutes</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Got this toy, which was advertised for strong chewers, and my dog broke it within an hour, so I had to throw it away.

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Accidentally bought these without realizing they're for dogs up to 35 lbs... oops (my 55 lb dog still enjoyed them).. I'm not sure if these are actually flavored but my dog definitely has a preference for these over some of her plain bones.

I will definitely be buying this pack again. I only wish they made a bigger size since my Rottweiler/Pitbull 6 month old almost looks like he's going to swallow it whole sometimes, so we can't leave it in his crate with him while we're at work, just in case.

They either chew it or bring it to me for a tug of war (I know it is not meant for it). It is a bit heavy so I don't like to throw because I don't want to hit hit my dogs or the walls, although my dogs prefer to go fetch it and then tug with me. Lasts a long time.

She does eventually crack it open but it takes about 3-6 months. And she can still chew on it once it’s cracked because she doesn’t pull pieces off. It’s worth it to find a toy that doesn’t squeak, lasts quite a while AND doesn’t require a treat for the dog to love it.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our boston terrier stayed entertained and happy with this, this is very easy to clean, doesnt attract fur or have a rubber smell like other kong toys, and lasted HOURS with our dog.

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I purchased two of these (the other one was larger).  My dog has had nylabones before and they generally last 2 to 3 months before I need to replace them.   I gave him the larger one first, and within 15 minutes, pieces of it were all over my carpet.  So... I threw out the first one and replaced it with this one and, pithing 10 to 15 minutes, the same thing happened.   Very dissatisfied.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This chew is great! My pup has some tough chompers and lesser toys have bitten the dust rather quickly, but this bone was a long-loved favorite of hers. It lasted about 10 months before I had to take it away from her because she had chewed it down on one end and it got too rough for her mouth. It can get a little messy since it comes off in little scraps as they chew, but other than that this was fantastic.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My little power chewer LOVES this bone!  She wrestles with it, throws in down the stairs and then chases it, and eventually (months later) chews it down to a nub.  She is the epitome of a power chewer, and nothing stands up to her chewing like this large nylabone.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My experiences has been that different dogs like different toys and chews. This dog is an approx. one year old stray who, after being through the shelter and search for owner process, is here to stay. He seems to be easily trainable but still, guiltily, has made some teeth marks on a few things. He chewed through some hard rubber toys in a couple of days. He chews on this bone throughout the day, and nothing comes off! Happy dog.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My super chewer loves this bone toy.  Nylabones are about the only toy he can enjoy safely.  Chewy has great prices on these so I usually add one to my dog food order to get free shipping!!  Love Chewy!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Very strong and she took right to it. Many chew toys have been destroyed in minutes. This one is sticking with her and she enjoys chewing on it, but hasn’t destroyed it. I would recommend it.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This was a pretty expensive bone and extremely heavy. My dog is 62 pounds and loves bones but does not really care for this one. Since the first day I gave her this bone she tried at times to chew on it then within seconds puts it down and walks away and does not bother at all with it. This isn't Chewys fault just the bone. I think it's just too hard and way too heavy. And way too much money for a bone!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I didn't expect my dog to love it so much. When I took it out of the package, I thought it was too hard for her, and I couldn't smell the chicken flavor. I just thought I wasted money again buying her chew toys she does not like. But Darla loves it so much, she carries it everywhere she goes and enjoys chewing it under my bed. It's really funny to hear her chewing sounds.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I wasn't too ecstatic about the cost but it's worth it. These bones are tough enough for extreme power chewers. They're quite heavy but nothing large breed dogs can't handle. I originally received one of these in a bundle pack but because I was so impressed, I purchased another separately. I can see these lasting a very long time.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Let me tell you, my dog will destroy EVERYTHING. She finds a weak spot in everything I give her and WILL tear it up ASAP. I gave her this bone about 1 in the afternoon, its currently 9:30 PM. All toys would have been demolished and thrown away by now. This one is a fighter! Shes been chewing almost all day and only left chew marks on the ends. This is SUPER long lasting and so worth every penny! My smaller Shih Tzu had no interest in this bone or the smaller ones I gave her, so be careful if your dog is picky.

My dog has had nylabones before and they generally last 2 to 3 months before I need to replace them.   I gave him the larger one first, and within 15 minutes, pieces of it were all over my carpet.  So... I threw out the first one and replaced it with this one and, pithing 10 to 15 minutes, the same thing happened.   Very dissatisfied.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This chew is great! My pup has some tough chompers and lesser toys have bitten the dust rather quickly, but this bone was a long-loved favorite of hers. It lasted about 10 months before I had to take it away from her because she had chewed it down on one end and it got too rough for her mouth. It can get a little messy since it comes off in little scraps as they chew, but other than that this was fantastic.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My little power chewer LOVES this bone!  She wrestles with it, throws in down the stairs and then chases it, and eventually (months later) chews it down to a nub.  She is the epitome of a power chewer, and nothing stands up to her chewing like this large nylabone.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My experiences has been that different dogs like different toys and chews. This dog is an approx. one year old stray who, after being through the shelter and search for owner process, is here to stay. He seems to be easily trainable but still, guiltily, has made some teeth marks on a few things. He chewed through some hard rubber toys in a couple of days. He chews on this bone throughout the day, and nothing comes off! Happy dog.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My super chewer loves this bone toy.  Nylabones are about the only toy he can enjoy safely.  Chewy has great prices on these so I usually add one to my dog food order to get free shipping!!  Love Chewy!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Very strong and she took right to it. Many chew toys have been destroyed in minutes. This one is sticking with her and she enjoys chewing on it, but hasn’t destroyed it. I would recommend it.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This was a pretty expensive bone and extremely heavy. My dog is 62 pounds and loves bones but does not really care for this one. Since the first day I gave her this bone she tried at times to chew on it then within seconds puts it down and walks away and does not bother at all with it. This isn't Chewys fault just the bone. I think it's just too hard and way too heavy. And way too much money for a bone!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I didn't expect my dog to love it so much. When I took it out of the package, I thought it was too hard for her, and I couldn't smell the chicken flavor. I just thought I wasted money again buying her chew toys she does not like. But Darla loves it so much, she carries it everywhere she goes and enjoys chewing it under my bed. It's really funny to hear her chewing sounds.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I wasn't too ecstatic about the cost but it's worth it. These bones are tough enough for extreme power chewers. They're quite heavy but nothing large breed dogs can't handle. I originally received one of these in a bundle pack but because I was so impressed, I purchased another separately. I can see these lasting a very long time.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Let me tell you, my dog will destroy EVERYTHING. She finds a weak spot in everything I give her and WILL tear it up ASAP. I gave her this bone about 1 in the afternoon, its currently 9:30 PM. All toys would have been demolished and thrown away by now. This one is a fighter! Shes been chewing almost all day and only left chew marks on the ends. This is SUPER long lasting and so worth every penny! My smaller Shih Tzu had no interest in this bone or the smaller ones I gave her, so be careful if your dog is picky. My shih Tzu prefers the smelly bones and I buy her the healthy edibles ones because they smell. This bone has no smell and leaves no residue.</span>]\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This broke down quickly and won't ever hold treats. I am very disappointed. The treats would last so much longer and our dog would love ethis toy if the treat would stay inside. But it pops out after a few minutes. Every time. Even when we insert it as the instructions say. Then he just gets a treat. An expensive treat to last just one night.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I thought this was the perfect chew for my little Aussie. The first two times he had it he gently licked away and the treat lasted the entire day and into the next. Unheard of with this pup. Unfortunately, since the first two uses, the treats now easily come out. He gulps them down and they do not last for any length of time. There are no tears holes or punctures in the rubber. Its hard for ME to get the treat in the toy but now easy for him to get it out? Really disappointed as I thought this was the perfect toy. The effectiveness is very short lived for the price sadly.</span>\n",

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I bought two of these treat toys for my two dogs.  One is a power chewer.  I find the toy part is very tough and holds up well to a power chewer.  The down side is the treat ball that comes with the toy.  It just gets sticky and gross as the dogs lick at it.  At one point, my power chewer was able to pop it out and started to eat it outright.  I caught it and was able to take it away.  She popped it out multiple times, finally I flipped it around and inserted it backwards . That made it harder for her to remove.  Definitely supervise your dogs at all times with this toy.  I had purchased a pack of treat refills, but  I don’t think i will use any time soon.  The actual toy is good quality, so </span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">While the treat inside the toy may not have been everlasting, the toy itself has zero damage against our 1.5 yr old Aussie Shepard mix. She’s a big chewer and usually takes minutes to devour her chew treats/give damage to toys but this one frustrates her and makes her work for it which is great. The disc treats seem a little easier for her to get out, still frustrating and take time, but overall less time than the ball treats that the toy comes with that they also sell. For our pup it was easily a 30 min-hour ordeal depending on the treat. And the toy as I said has zero damage so far with multiple plays.

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I was so excited to get this \"everlasting treat\", hoping I could use it to occupy my 'big boy\" while my kids &amp; I eat. I was expecting it to be a solid ball of treat in the hard rubber holder. It ended up being a semi-flat disc of treat that my dog was able to devour in 10 minutes. The outside holder is definitely strong enough to survive my dog's powerful bite but the treat itself was disappointing. I thought I'd be able to use it while we ate, take it back and give it to him again and again as a training device until my dog learned to not beg and drool everywhere when we eat. The fact that the treat only lasted 10 minutes before he had it out of the holder and completely gone was frustrating</span>\n",

But they where on the high $$$$ side</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We buy a different Nylabone for our 80-pound Shepherd mix every month with his food shipment. This was the first time we'd tried this one. He chewed it for a few minutes then suddenly let out a yelp. We checked him out and couldn't see what was wrong. He avoided the Nylabone for the rest of the day, though. The next day, he picked it up again and almost immediately dropped it and actually backed away from it as though it had hurt him. He then studiously avoided it for the rest of the day, giving it a wide berth, not wanting to go near it. We have no idea what happened, but it obviously hurt him. We threw it in the trash, and it wasn't cheap!

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I bought this for our 10 month old AmStaff who quickly destroys 99% of the toys she is given - including those designed for \"bully breeds\". So far so good on this one. It is quite heavy which may have something to do with why it hasn't ended up in the trash yet. It is harder for her to pick up and carry around and due to the overall size, harder for her to get her jaws around. She does like playing with it though and I am impressed it has lasted more than a week.</span>\n",

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I purchased this on 12/5/2018 for for my 50lb pit bull after she chewed through black kong toys within 2 weeks.  After a few days of getting used to the weight..She loves it!  She chews it and plays fetch with it every day.  I think she actually goes through anxiety if she does not know where it is.  It is now the end of July 2020 and it is starting to show a teeny bit of red in the center.  I will be purchasing a replacement.  Definitely worth the price.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This toy is quite heavy and I think would take a very aggressive chewer to make a dent in it. We wanted it for a pool fetch toy. It doesn’t work well for that use as it doesn’t float well. It sinks down with the slightest touch and takes time to return to surface. If your dog likes to go under water then probably a good fit. I’m sure we will have this toy a long time.</span>\n",

Its rubber but not hard rubber, you can hear him chewing. All the hard toys make his teeth bleed but not this ring. All there is are little dots where his teeth are. He breaks everything in sight so finding a “strong chewer” toy is always impossible. He is obsessed with it and carries it everywhere. Its been a month and he hasnt made a dent. 100% recommend and if you’re ify on spending the money go and buy it! I have no doubts. There is a tougher one that doesn’t float in water as well but this one seemed to do the trick.</span>\n",

Loves to play fetch with it, just carry it around, will intermittently try to chew on it. The shape seems hard to chew &amp; hold onto though, which makes it more fun. She loves to gnaw thru nylabones so we bought this so we wouldn’t have to guess when it was time to trash it. We can hardly see any chew marks on the goughnut so certainly don’t think it is nearing the end of its lifespan. \n",

Now, I am kicking myself because I’m out nearly $30 on a toy that just sits there...and I finally put it away because I kept stubbing my toe on it. It is HEAVY, which I wonder might be one reason she doesn’t like it. Severely disappointed customer here...</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I bought this for our 10 month old AmStaff who quickly destroys 99% of the toys she is given - including those designed for \"bully breeds\". So far so good on this one. It is quite heavy which may have something to do with why it hasn't ended up in the trash yet. It is harder for her to pick up and carry around and due to the overall size, harder for her to get her jaws around. She does like playing with it though and I am impressed it has lasted more than a week.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I was afraid to buy this since it is pretty pricey and my dog destroys everything but I’m so glad I did! I have a 95 lbs pit bull and he destroys everything within 5 minutes. We’ve had this toy for 4 weeks and he hasn’t been able to tear it apart at all! I will recommend this toy to everyone!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I purchased this on 12/5/2018 for for my 50lb pit bull after she chewed through black kong toys within 2 weeks.  After a few days of getting used to the weight..She loves it!  She chews it and plays fetch with it every day.  I think she actually goes through anxiety if she does not know where it is.  It is now the end of July 2020 and it is starting to show a teeny bit of red in the center.  I will be purchasing a replacement.  Definitely worth the price.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This toy is quite heavy and I think would take a very aggressive chewer to make a dent in it. We wanted it for a pool fetch toy. It doesn’t work well for that use as it doesn’t float well. It sinks down with the slightest touch and takes time to return to surface. If your dog likes to go under water then probably a good fit. I’m sure we will have this toy a long time.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">It is definitely heavy-duty... our dog is a chewer and this thing has barely a mark on it after 2 weeks.  Our dog loves it... she'll play with it, and then when it's in a different room, she'll run out and go find it and bring it to wherever she is.  \n",

      "We ordered the largest size for our 60lb lab mix.  It's big - not a bad thing... just read carefully which size you're ordering.  We got exactly what we wanted and what we ordered, but for some reason, it didn't seem as big when we ordered it as it ended up being in real life.  The photos would be best to have something like a soda can, tennis ball, coin or something for reference.  \n",

      "The main concern/complaint we have with it is the odor.  </span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We have three dogs in our home, including one puppy who loves to chew. None of the dogs will touch this. I am sure it is very indestructible, but the dogs aren’t interested. It does smell intensely of rubber. Even after putting peanut butter on it, they still could care less.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I was excited to find this product but my dogs won’t touch it :(  I don’t know if it’s because it smells or what but they do not touch this toy</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have a 75lb english bulldog and he LOVES it. It doesn’t even tear or break which amazes me. Its rubber but not hard rubber, you can hear him chewing. All the hard toys make his teeth bleed but not this ring. All there is are little dots where his teeth are. He breaks everything in sight so finding a “strong chewer” toy is always impossible. He is obsessed with it and carries it everywhere. Its been a month and he hasnt made a dent. 100% recommend and if you’re ify on spending the money go and buy it! I have no doubts. There is a tougher one that doesn’t float in water as well but this one seemed to do the trick.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our pup has had this toy for almost 7 months, and it is one of the first she hasn’t destroyed. (!!!) Loves to play fetch with it, just carry it around, will intermittently try to chew on it. The shape seems hard to chew &amp; hold onto though, which makes it more fun. She loves to gnaw thru nylabones so we bought this so we wouldn’t have to guess when it was time to trash it. We can hardly see any chew marks on the goughnut so certainly don’t think it is nearing the end of its lifespan. \n",

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Unfortunately my pup chewed one end to the point he was biting off chunks. It took a day or two, but he is an aggressive chewer. It’s so difficult to find toys that will entertain him and not become a hazard. \n",

They seem tough and like they would stand up well, but they do have a rubber odor, and they are quite heavy. No fault to the toy itself, I’ve had a lot of recommendations for this brand of toy, so I figured we’d try it. If your dogs like chewing other rubber type toys they might like goughnuts too.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our 2 Staffordshire Bull Terriers love playing with the GoughNuts ring toy, so I ordered the \"Stick\" and they love it just as much.  It's more of a challenge for them to use when playing tug-o-war but they play with it alot.  It really smells of rubber, but I'm not complaining.... this is well worth the money for our two big-mouthed babies and their strong jaws.  Highly recommend.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My pitbull is a power chewer and, if unsupervised, will continue to gnaw on his toys until they’re in pieces. I bought this toy because I really liked the safety feature that let owners know when to take the toy away, but didn’t expect it to last as long as it has! He loves chewing it, play tug, and fetch with this toy and there isn’t a scratch on it! We didn’t think it would last a day, let alone two weeks (and still intact!), because the rubber seemed soft and he could easily chew it to pieces just like others that came before him. Turns out, it’s just soft enough to be difficult to penetrate its outer barrier! Very happy with this purchase and worth the price tag.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I never write reviews! We got the Maxx version of this stick for my power chewer Northern breed mix, Rigby. He chews on this almost daily for thirty minutes or more. It is virtually unscathed other than some teeth marks. If you have a chewer who has destroyed other rubber toys, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this toy in the black, Maxx version specifically. I will say it is quite heavy so it might not be a big hit with a smaller dog (say less than 40ish pounds?).</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I was excited to purchase this for my power chewer.  Within the first day you could see little teeth marks.

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I bought this on a whim because we canceled our BarkBox subscription a few months back and my dog misses getting new toys every month lol. She is a pitbull and will destroy toys in minutes, unless they're the thick rubber material. So I got this one, hoping it would be ok. She absolutely -LOVES- it. It's easy to pull out of her mouth when we play, because it's smooth, and it's dense but not HARD. It has a little flexibility to it. It's sturdy and she hasn't even made any marks on it, which is crazy. I'm really glad I got it!</span>\n",

I do recommend buying the raised sided refills for this item.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Large is for a really big dog, or large dogs with really long noses, like a Collie maybe. I have a Rottweiler, a full sized labradoodle, and a Springer Spaniel..The spaniel loves to carry this around with him, but NONE of them can get the treats inside out. The ball does appear to be very tough, and the outside grooves are fairly deep. Still, I wouldn't put food in them unless you don't care about crumbs and pieces on your floor. \n",

This soft feeling \"tough chew toy\" came with one biscuit, and no more were in stock at the time. I was thrilled at first when he took it under his chair and was occupied with it for quite a while.

It's easy to throw with the attached rope and it floats above the water so it's easy for a dog to see.  It seems impervious to pond water muck and leeches.  Our dog does not chew on this toy so I can't speak for that aspect, but in all other ways, it works perfectly.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">It throws well, it's got great visibility, it's easy for my husky to grab, and it dries fairly quickly. Plus she loves the little string on the end; every time it moves she throws it down and pounces on it like a fearsome huntress!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We've used this for several swims now. It stays afloat, and the bright color makes it easy for the pups to track. The cutest thing ever is when my pup and my parent's pup retrieve it together. Definitely worth the money!</span>,\n",

My 10 month old GSD LOVED these but the stitching starting coming apart on day one and the bumpers were completely destroyed by day 2.  Very disappointed, I wish they would re-engineer these with stronger stitching.  I would buy them again if they were re-engineered however would NEVER buy them again as is.  Very poorly constructed.</span>,\n",

I have a Bernedoodle and Dobie. This toy lasted a long time until a family member left it outside and the Dobie tore it to shreds. He tears everything to shreds because he’s a chewer. I’m buying another today!</span>,\n",

I saw the plastic pieces and checked for the squeaker and couldn’t find it. Got a bit worried so I cut a slit in the other end and was happy to see there is no plastic squeaker! It’s a tube inside the bulb, and hollow otherwise. I’m not sure that I’d buy this again, given it didn’t hold up like the black Kong products do, but it’s good to know there’s no squeaker hazard. And the end I cut still squeaks!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 80 pound catahoula love this thing. I don't necessarily like getting smacked in the leg by it when he shakes it like a squirrel, lol, but he has so much fun with it I'm willing to let that go. It's big enough for tug of war, tough enough for chewing, and squeaks just enough for him to stay interested but not so much that everyone in the room gets a headache. Definitely one of our favorite toys.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This toy held up for 2 months with my dog primarily playing fetch on land and in water. The true test began when I started taking it with us to the dog park. It survived for several play sessions, but once the dogs started tugging on it they were able to rip the bulbs off the end. However, I would purchase again as it’s a durable toy and it provided my pittie with many enjoyable play sessions.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This toy is unbelievably fun for my dogs.  It is sturdy for my chewers, who usually demolish toys within minutes.  The squeaking stimulates them to step on it, carry it around, toss it from their mouths and try to play tug o war.  It's a tough toy, and I'm so glad I discovered it for my doggies.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog (2 year old border collie), destroys everything I get him that says it’s for tough chewers and it’s really frustrating when you drop a good amount of money on it. But this one is affordable and he has a blast with it. It’s perfect length for tug of war plus the squeakers get him even more excited. \n",
       "   Would definitely recommend:)</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our Goldendoodle is a toy destroyer and this one doesn’t even have a tooth mark on it after a couple weeks of play. He loves to use those tiny front teeth to try to pull the seams apart. Both ends are squeakers which is a great surprise and joy to our pup. Great toy for fetch and doesn’t bounce super high so safer for indoor tossing as well.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 50lb bully destroys everything she that goes into her mouth. I've had one of these babies for almost 9 months. While she did shred the squeakers on the ends within one month, the center stick has continued to last. It's her absolute favorite toy and she carries it almost everywhere. She's been slowly biting off bits from the ends but it's a pretty solid stick so it will take her a while. I bought 2 more and give her access to the new ones that still have intact squeakers every now and then, but otherwise she's perfectly happy with her squeaker-less center stick piece.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My lab usually destroys everything and we have had issues in the past with toys. So he doesn’t have many. Kong came through again with this toy. It has held up and makes him happy. I find my dog napping with it.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I really like this toy and I had very high hopes that it would last. I have two strong chewers and they chewed through the end after having the toy only two days. But even busted, I can still throw it around and play fetch with it.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My pit LOVES to chew his toys especially squeaking ones they are his favorite but his 1st goal is to get to that squeaker. Anyways this is in my top 5 toys I can get him that actually lasts. Yes he had those squeakers broken the 1st day but he still loves to chew on this and it hasnt been chewed up yet so I will for sure buy again for him.</span>]},\n",

Maybe a shelter can use it as my dog didn’t touch it but not sure I feel right even donating it due to the smell /.

The material, however, is not very chew resistant and considering that this is supposed to be a chew toy, we were very disappointed. It lasted less than 1 day before he was chewing off tiny pieces that he was swallowing. That was the end of that toy - in the trash it went!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">The quality and durability is better than I had expected. I love not hearing a squeak every time my dog bites down on it. My moms dog tried it out before my dog he’s a doxie the dog using the dog is a pit mix and he’s been chewing it all day and hasn’t broken through yet</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This was an enormous hit with my bottle cronching puppy... Much less plastic waste, no pieces to gnaw off, satisfying crinkly crunch when chewed. It has a pleasant rubber texture and smells nice (kinda sweet?) and TBH I love the glitter finish. She's still a puppy so I dont know how it will hold up for extreme chewers but she loves it.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Originally bought for my puppy who likes it, but my 8 y/o girl LOVES IT! can’t get enough of the crackle sound. Rolls it around for herself and chews on it so happily to hear the noise. Great for fetch in the house too. it make us all laugh at her goofy grin and wagging tail. Definitely recommended, supervise play as always</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I saw the pictures of broken off pieces on other reviews after I purchased this. However, two of my tough chewers have been gnawing on it all day for two days and it is perfectly in tact. I am sure over time it will break down but it’s nice to know that it is durable enough to hopefully get my money’s worth first! I think it helped that I bought a medium instead of a small size for the pugs because they really had to work at it to chew on it- but the crackle had them so obsessed that they managed to do it.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">The end popped off on the first bite, after that she had it chewed within an hour. Had to remove it, NOT KONG STRONG!!!!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I purchased this because of the Kong brand. Unfortunately after a couple days, my dog was able to chew the end right off</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">A number of reviews say that this toy didn't last long with their pet, but my Rottweiler puppy (who loves destroying her toys) always played with this and loved it. Didn't have a problem with the durability until she had the toy (and had used it quite a bit) for about 4-5 months. Then she started to be able to pull away the rubber coating and pull out the plastic inside, so it quickly went in the trash. Overall a pretty good toy!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I assumed that since this toy was made from Kong, it was durable. This is not the same material on the Kong toy. Know your chewer before you purchase this. My mini poodle mix would probably hang on to this for a long time. But its first day with my bf’s retriever puppy, his teeth pierced through and it’s slowly being ripped up. I personally don’t like letting dogs play with toys in this state because then you need to worry about making sure the dog doesn’t eat the pieces. Proceed with caution !</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog is not an obsessive chewer, but she is a wild player. Within a few hours of fetch and vigorous head shaking it was beginning to crack apart. The crackle center fell out after the second day. However, for the time that it lasted my pup very much enjoyed it.</span>]},\n",

Unfortunately the flying disc was the first toy she destroyed, followed by the ball.  The blue plastic bone is slowly being chewed up but after she chews that off, she'll still have the rope toy underneath!  So essentially she has 6 solid rope toys that (so far) are indestructible.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 8 month old bichon mix chewed through the plastic of the bone rope toy within a week and the round rope/frisbee within minutes.

Sadly, this variety pack isn’t working out too well for us.</span>,\n",

Within 5 minutes, my 5 month old puppy chewed through the blue part of the rope frisbee.  I cut off the blue part allowing him to chew the rope and he chewed through that and the glue that held it together.  I had to take it away from him in less than 24 hours.  This was the toy he gravitated to.   Time will tell how the other toys hold up.</span>,\n",

Plus, there is a squeaker in its head and a rope in its body. Its both fun to use as a tug toy as well as comfort chewing for teething. It's held up really well and whenever he does end up destroying this toy, I'll be buying this again.</span>,\n",

The threads that made the rope are kinda soft and east to rip small threads apart. My pup does like it tho, however, I constantly find small pieces of the rope threads all around the house. Not recommend for those that like to rip things apart.</span>,\n",

I probably wasn't paying attention to the length when we ordered it, definitely not long enough to play tug of war.

He however hasn't destroyed this one yet and the reason why is not because it's \"indestructible\" but because when I'm done playing with this toy it gets put up until next time increasing it's usability.

With this bone however, long lasting durability was not the case. When I first picked it up, I could gently shake it and hear the squeaker mechanism lightly rattling in the toy.

I first found one at TJMaxx and she played with it for many months, maybe even a year, before she managed to dismantle it (which is pretty impressive, given that she can destroy a stuffed animal in less than 10 minutes).  I was so happy to find it on Chewy!  Unfortunately, the seams on the one I ordered started to rip in just a couple of hours and after few weeks it is completely trashed.

But they love them, and I will continue to buy these rings for them util I can't find them any longer.</span>]},\n",

Had to take him to the vet because the rope didn't pass through him without help!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our 8 month puppy is completely into demolishing his toys right now. He’s really exercising his jaws and teeth. So I don’t expect toys to last too long. I did think this rope toy would last longer than an hour. He found the weakness in a side seam and the toy was beyond repair. We still let him play with it but had to remove any stuffing. I think it’s a great toy if your pup wants to play tug of war and isn’t so much into tug and  destroy.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I buy and endorse Kong toys on a regular basis, but this one was a disappointment.  The tug ropes on each end are too small for an adult hand to hang onto,  The squeaker is a HUGE disappointment.  It is located in just one of the legs and very hard to find.  It barely squeaked.  The inside of the toy is rope like the handles, but it's not a chew toy, so I'm confused.  It was a gift for a friend's new puppy - he didn't seem intrigued.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">we received this as a gift to our new puppy who’s 9mo. It broke within ten seconds of her playing with it. The ropes completely tore apart and our puppy was eating them within a blink of an eye—I’m not kidding. I wish I was. I’ve never seen a dog toy rip apart so easily. Our puppy is 50lbs and not a very aggressive chewer so it was quite startling to have the toy completely break and fall apart within seconds of having it. I had to cut the rope part off just so she could still remotely play with it since she was starting to try to eat the torn rope ends. I would not recommend this toy unless your dog literally does chew at all.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Both my 80+ lb boxer dogs love this toy. They play tug a war. It has held up well and this is my second one of this style, the other was a monkey I bought quite a while ago, he is still surviving.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">It is recommended as a tough chew toy, but my dogs had both the fluff and the rope ends pulled out within an hour. Very disappointed.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Archie was able to completely deconstruct this thing rather quickly; even the tug o’ war element. I realize nothing lasts forever, especially when given to a 80lb monster with jaws of steel. However, the people at Kong are wacky if they think this product is a deal at nearly $20. Not the worst, but certainly not a house favorite.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We thought we’d give Kong tuggerknots toys a try, as they have a good reputation for quality. Our Airedales love to play with relatively soft toys, especially with a squeaker, but they have a knack for chewing off the fabric. I wish Kong would make a plush like toy for dogs who need to use the black Kong for biting (they can destroy the red ones). Still on the hunt for the elusive perfect plush toy for hard chewers.</span>,\n",

He had a great time with the toy, it's just not as long lasting as claimed.</span>]},\n",

The new mammoth Large  tire biter Is only 6” in diameter and the old large size was 10” in diameter.

Oh well, on to probably another KONG toy.  Thanks, Chewy!</span>,\n",

My dog went through the rope immediately and not thinking saw him throw up rope particles, not fun. Cut the rope out and gave my chewer the tire which is indestructible and he had a blast with it. Still able to play tug of war with his sister and play with on his own. The rope part is just awful. I say just buy the tire part and get them excited about it and it will be their next great toy.</span>,\n",

I'm glad I took the risk! One of my dogs is a tug of war fanatic. He gets so into it he doesn't always pay attention to where he grabs and will sometimes get your fingers. He will also leave you with barely any rope for you to play along. Sally allowed me and Cocoa to have plenty of places to grab and hold onto. Now I don't have to worry about losing a finger haha. This item is also great if you would like your dogs to play tug of war together :].</span>,\n",

The only bad thing is if your dog is a chewer.  My dog tore the little football up quickly and I have to cut it off the toy.  The braid part is the best part.  It lasts a long time, but don't leave it in the sun!  Our first one finally disintegrated and I had to get a new one.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I'm so disappointed.  I had hoped that this toy would bring lots of playtime for my dog. Instead,  it tore apart in under a week.  There's a great big hole in the seam.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My pitsky quickly shreds every toy we buy with her seam-ripper teeth and surgical squeaker-remover skills. With this toy, it took her 24 hours to destroy the football on the end, which is more than 20 times longer than most toys take. The braided rope has since then been a favorite toy for playing tug with her humans, running around shaking, and chewing. After a few weeks, it's not showing any signs of wear and tear and she hasn't lost interest in it.</span>,\n",

She usually ends up breaking up the rope and does chew through it, but it takes her a couple weeks to get through them. They come in handy for tug of war and chewing! Every time I bring one home or get it delivered, she is beyond excited. We both LOVE these ropes!</span>,\n",

       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I've bought this particular toy for my tug-o-war lovin' dogs many times and it's usually held up pretty well considering the energy my one particular dog puts into trying to destroy it. Unfortunately, just a day after a bought a new one, the dogs were playing tug-o-war and the rope pulled out because the knot was not big enough. Now I'm left with a ball that is incredibly hard to play with and a rope that the dogs have minimal interest in. This has happened before but not so shortly after receiving it! Why can't they make the knots a little more substantial so that this doesn't happen? I've tried to shove it back through but it's very difficult and it's near impossible to undo and then re-do </span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My girl loves rhe Romp n Roll but only wants the 4.5 size.  I think she likes to carry it in her mouth and can't do that with the bigger sizes which would seem to be more appropriate for a bigger dog.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I bought this toy for my 1 year old Rottweiler (~80 pounds). She loves regular Jolly Balls, but after a couple of weeks of play would rip the handles off of them from swinging them around. This version of the toy is great in that it has a rope through it that she can use to swing the ball around instead of an attached handle that can break off. The ball itself is much more rigid than a straight Jolly Ball, and feels a little heavier, but that doesn't stop her from whipping it around. Highly recommend for larger, strong dogs who like a good game of tug or for dogs who like to roughhouse with big toys.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have an ACD that loves to destroy toys.  This toy is definitely his favorite.  Thank goodness it can withstand his chewing and he grabs the rope to sling it back and forth.  I have to reinforce the knots or with his play he will pull the rope through the ball.  He will retrieve it all day just to have it thrown or kicked just so he can chase it.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 9 month old English Mastiff has torn apart every toy including his three Kong toys.

       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our initial purchase was the larger red Romp-n-roll which our 71 pound lab mix absolutely loves. It stays outside as it is larger. He loves to run with it and swing it around. It's very entertaining for him. We purchased the purple one and it stays indoors. It's the perfect size and he loves it as much as the red one. It does not deflate even with tiny puncture holes and the rope has held up incredibly well. Would purchase either again.</span>]},\n",

I bring a few special toys out, and each time my neighbor dog comes by he grabs various toys - mainly any West Paw toys I have laying on the ground in my yard, then he and my dog begin a game of chase/keep away with each other. It is hilarious, and my neighbor dog always tries taking the West Paw toys with him when it's time to go home. My dog really enjoys playing fetch, tug, and keep away with this toy, among others from this brand. I like that they have different styles based on their chewing habits.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Maybe I misunderstood the description, I thought would last longer for moderate chewer-it was destroyed the same day it was given to our dog. I will only purchase for extremely aggressive chewer from now on.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This toy is my dog’s most favorite toy. He enjoys playing fetch with it, but he is also content to tote it around while walking about the house or just chew on it while lounging. He is an avid chewer, but he is not as hard on toys as my other dog. Both of my dogs are fine with these though, and they hold up well. For reference, both of my dogs are medium build. My male dog is a lab mix, and my female dog is a pitt mix.  We have bought other West Paw toys with a lot of success. The first one I purchased was going strong for well over six months until a family member’s golden retriever mix gnawed off one of the ends. My dogs still enjoy that toy though, and it has still held up, even with an end</span>,\n",

Granted, our GSP is a destructive chewer, but he chomped through this is under 30 minutes, leaving us with two ... well, let's just say \"rudely suggestive\" pieces and leave it at that. It went straight into the trash. Save your money, buy something sturdier.</span>,\n",

He plays tug of war with it every day, sits and chews on it for hours, and it’s great for fetch. Has not broken even with extremely rough play. West paw continues to impress me, but this is by far the best toy they have created! I’ve tried many heavy duty toys and none have compared to this.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog Atticus 3 year old rescue Boston Terrier is an avid Chewer. West Paw is a great brand. It gives him a chew challenge yet doesn’t break apart so no danger of him swallowing it. I think they are a bit pricy, but happy to pay for it considering I don’t have to worry about paying the vet for swallowing rubber pieces! He especially loves the long three knob stick in Purple. His favorite of many!</span>,\n",

       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog doesn't chew a lot, but when he does he will destroy any toy you give him... except this one. We play fetch &amp; tug games together, or I just let him chew on this when he doesn't want a bone. And, it looks pretty much the same as the day we bought it.

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">... ours would say “new favorite toy”! If you don’t like noise, then don’t get this toy. It’s the equivalent of giving a toddler a noisy toy, and your pup will be obsessed. I love seeing how happy he is, and the sound really doesn’t bother me! Especially since he’s been destroying things in the house lately, meaning that whenever I hear the toy, I know he is behaving! He carries it around the house, play bows to it, bats it around to make more noise, it’s incredible. What a happy and engaged pup!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our older lab couldn't care less, our little Pomsky is afraid of it, but our Corgi just goes wild over it! She looks toward the cubby hole where I store it each day when she thinks it's time to play.  I put it down on the floor and she chases it all over the house, pushing it with her nose and barking the entire time.  She only stops when she needs a drink of water or she's just exhausted.  If you have a dog that loves to play and isn't afraid of crazy, wacky sounds, this might be the toy you're looking for.  It seems to be well constructed too, so I expect it to last a while.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This is the best toy of any we have purchased for our puppy, who is now just over 3 months.  At first, he was a little afraid of it and barked at it after he pushed it around and it made noise.  Then I followed the instructions and said, \"good boy\" each time he made it make a sound.  Right after that, he was pushing it all over, having a blast.  He kept playing long after I walked into the next room.  Within a few minutes, he figured out how to pick it up in his mouth and carry it.  I'd say this one is a hit!!  :)</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This toy will keep your larger babies busy for hours.  My boy, Max, loves it.  He will chace it for as long as I will let him. \n",
      "\n",
      "The nice thing is it is sturdy and tough.  It won't break easily and last for as long as you take care of it (example: don't run over it). \n",
      "\n",
      "My recommendation, if you have a larger dog that likes noise you should buy this for them.  It will be the last noise maker you'll every buy or want to buy for them.  They will love it and you will enjoy watching them have fun with it.  Worth every penny.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My pup is a chaser so I thought he would love this. He will chase literally anything normally, even light reflections. However, he did not know what to do with this ball! It became more of a nuisance having to move it around to show him what to do verse a fun activity for him to play with unfortunately. I think there are better interactive toys out there Chewy has to offer than this ball, especially at this price.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have tried this toy a couple times because my dog obsesses over it however if you take your eyes off him for even a minute it’s destroyed he bites through it like butter and he’s only 40 pounds this is supposed to be for dogs well sizes and durable. Great idea but sadly will not be buying again I am worried he will get a blockage from eating the pieces. It took them over five minutes to put this hole in it.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 16-year-old Jack Russell mix is mostly blind and deaf. However, he still likes to chase his toys and play with them by himself.  He doesn’t know what to make of this toy. He responds when I roll it, but just sniffs it and walks away. It seems to be too large for him to move and the indentations are too far apart for him to get his mouth around, so he can’t pick it u.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This is a fun ball for my hyper chewing puppy/dog. At first he was afraid of the sounds, but the more we laughed, the easier it became for him to play. It rolls really well on wooden floors and speaks sounds, sentences that seem to be echolalic. My pup loves for us to play soccer with him and sometimes as he’s zooming, he plays with it himself. It’s a fun ball for him, but it is heavy and not made of material for him to chew.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 8 months old female German shepherd/mastiff mix loves her ball. She enjoys throwing the ball, in the air, and rolling it down the hill. The ball seems to be waterproof, as we have forgot it outside, and it was rained on for a few days.  We have chucked this ball, and it works perfectly fine. This ball helps our dog, enjoy playing by herself, to gain independence.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Ah, no vidéo. Only allows photos &amp; that’s not fun. My terrier wears herself out playing with this toy. She barks &amp; growls. I think it’s because of the various noises. A great investment. She’s only 23 pounds so took her a few days to figure how to carry it in her mouth, but she did. Proudly. Now Mom has to go fetch if it ends up in the bedroom under the bed.</span>\n",

If you have a dog that loves to play and isn't afraid of crazy, wacky sounds, this might be the toy you're looking for.  It seems to be well constructed too, so I expect it to last a while.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This is the best toy of any we have purchased for our puppy, who is now just over 3 months.  At first, he was a little afraid of it and barked at it after he pushed it around and it made noise.  Then I followed the instructions and said, \"good boy\" each time he made it make a sound.  Right after that, he was pushing it all over, having a blast.  He kept playing long after I walked into the next room.  Within a few minutes, he figured out how to pick it up in his mouth and carry it.  I'd say this one is a hit!!  :)</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This toy will keep your larger babies busy for hours.  My boy, Max, loves it.  He will chace it for as long as I will let him. \n",

      "The nice thing is it is sturdy and tough.  It won't break easily and last for as long as you take care of it (example: don't run over it). \n",

      "My recommendation, if you have a larger dog that likes noise you should buy this for them.  It will be the last noise maker you'll every buy or want to buy for them.  They will love it and you will enjoy watching them have fun with it.  Worth every penny.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My pup is a chaser so I thought he would love this. He will chase literally anything normally, even light reflections. However, he did not know what to do with this ball! It became more of a nuisance having to move it around to show him what to do verse a fun activity for him to play with unfortunately. I think there are better interactive toys out there Chewy has to offer than this ball, especially at this price.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have tried this toy a couple times because my dog obsesses over it however if you take your eyes off him for even a minute it’s destroyed he bites through it like butter and he’s only 40 pounds this is supposed to be for dogs well sizes and durable. Great idea but sadly will not be buying again I am worried he will get a blockage from eating the pieces. It took them over five minutes to put this hole in it.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 16-year-old Jack Russell mix is mostly blind and deaf. However, he still likes to chase his toys and play with them by himself.  He doesn’t know what to make of this toy. He responds when I roll it, but just sniffs it and walks away. It seems to be too large for him to move and the indentations are too far apart for him to get his mouth around, so he can’t pick it u.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This is a fun ball for my hyper chewing puppy/dog. At first he was afraid of the sounds, but the more we laughed, the easier it became for him to play. It rolls really well on wooden floors and speaks sounds, sentences that seem to be echolalic. My pup loves for us to play soccer with him and sometimes as he’s zooming, he plays with it himself. It’s a fun ball for him, but it is heavy and not made of material for him to chew.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 8 months old female German shepherd/mastiff mix loves her ball. She enjoys throwing the ball, in the air, and rolling it down the hill. The ball seems to be waterproof, as we have forgot it outside, and it was rained on for a few days.  We have chucked this ball, and it works perfectly fine. This ball helps our dog, enjoy playing by herself, to gain independence.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Ah, no vidéo. Only allows photos &amp; that’s not fun. My terrier wears herself out playing with this toy. She barks &amp; growls. I think it’s because of the various noises. A great investment. She’s only 23 pounds so took her a few days to figure how to carry it in her mouth, but she did. Proudly. Now Mom has to go fetch if it ends up in the bedroom under the bed.</span>]\n",

They last a long time, but you do need to toss them when they start to come apart, which is why I’m buying his fourth one.  He seeks it out above all his other toys.

He was a little crazy over this box and I think he would like me to do this again. I did notice a slight difference in the squeak sound compared to the same size Kong balls but my dog didn’t care. If it tasted like a tennis ball and was squeaky until chomped to its death it was all good. I found them to be a good alternative</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">These balls were really nice, and seemed very well made. However, our dogs destroyed them very quickly. The felt material on the exterior ripped very easily, and the inside rubber crumbled once they bit into them.</span>]\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 5 month Pomsky loves these balls!!! She'll pick them over any of her other toys, time and time again. She loves to squeak it. I only give her one at a time and give it to her when she's being supervised 100% because she loves biting the nap off. Gave 3 stars because of how easy the nap comes off. I'm purchasing the larger ones to see if that helps since she can't fit them in her mouth like with the small ones.</span>\n",

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dogs are labs and weigh in the 60's. While they have soft mouths, they destroy the balls within minutes.

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our dog loves these! They are probably his favorite toy ever. We buy them in the medium and large size for him.

However:  While the Squeaker  was nice and really loud and my dog Breeze REALLY enjoyed it I would have to say that it didn’t live up to its name.  Saying that to say that the squeaker lasted every bit of 5 minutes.  Such a disappointment so now it makes a squishy sound and defeats the purpose and Breeze pretty much ignores it.

That’s when we have to throw it away.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have a Jack Russell who spends his days chasing this ball my Australian Shepherd steals it from him and chews on it makes it squeak incessantly they love it nice durable ball can’t get the squeaker out would definitely buy this again</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">He is an aggressive chewer and has had this for two months and still hasn’t punctured it. He is crazy about this ball. Ordering another in a different color because he loves it so much and gets sad if he can’t find it</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My two 80lb staffies like the blue medium ones, but they went bonkers over the orange ones. Bigger nubs for side chewing, very grippy rubber, great jaw exercise. One pulverizes toys and it’s held up quite nicely! We’ve never had one break.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This is a perfect chew toy, throwing ball, and squeaky toy all in one! The medium size is perfect for my pitbull because its big enough to prevent her from swallowing it and small enough to prevent her from tearing it up. She easily chewed up the x-large since it's big enough to put her paw on and really get in. I'm waiting on the large to come in stock to see what she does with that.</span>]\n",

But, that might just be my dog.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog loves them and don’t wear down his teeth like regular tennis balls, but recently on all of the ones I ordered, with in 1 day the felt covering comes off or ball splits on the seam and is broken in half, my dog is almost 8 years old and he only catches them he doesn’t chew on them, poor quality, Kong’s used to make good products but not any more</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">my two shepherds love these Kong squeakair balls.  I have about 8 of them all over the house and yard.  They last awhile, but my dogs are not big chewers.  Each ball has a different squeak sound and the two of them pick their favorite.  I have other toys for them, but they always want to play with the Kong balls.  They like the med size ones.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I didn’t realize this ball was so big. We have golden retrievers and they cannot easily pick up the ball due to it being so large. We also wanted it for pool retrieves and it absorbs water so should not be listed with water toys .</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Rocky, our 120 lb. pit bull is a sweetie, but he wants to get the squeaker out of any toy.  We tried this ball 2 years ago and he loved it!  Played for a whole 24 hours before he ripped it apart.  We decided to see if his maturity would help him take better care of this toy - in less than an hour he had punched a hole in the ball.  Unfortunately for Rocky, it's not Rocky proof.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our 105-lb Rottie loves her new ball! We did purchase the largest one so that she wouldn't have the chance to chew on it to nibble off pieces (her usual M.O. with all balls). When she sees it, she's ready to go &amp; we have to force her to take breaks. Thanks Again Chewy!!</span>]\n",

It wasn’t completely broken, so we shoved a chuckit breathe right ball inside to keep her occupied and she was easily able to break chunks off of this ball and tear it apart. We had to take it away and throw it in the garbage so she didn’t eat any little pieces. Might be good if you have a very gentle dog, but it won’t stand up to tug or any rough play with a 75lb GSD.

Thinking that the medium with the next size I ordered it and it’s so large and heavy, It’s bigger than his head and too much for him to carry he doesn’t like it. So it’s disappointing.

I bought it cause theres a grocery store about 5mins from my house that has a few dog toys that they sell for. 88cents &amp; there's one that has a tennis ball on it &amp; she loved it but it came apart I assumed it was cause it was so cheap. But it lasted longer than this.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog ripped through the plastic-like rope in 3 minutes. I vacuumed the pieces and we moved on. The ball is still in great shape though. Good toy for dogs who just want to fetch and retrieve. Not good for any amount of chewing.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I ordered several items for my dog's birthday.  She had the rope on this one destroyed in 1 minute.   Had to throw the entire toy in the trash,  so I didn't have to worry about her swallowing the rope strings.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Bad stuff my lab pup tore off the rope in 45 min he  almost swallowed the Rope not very tough and sturdy would say it’s good  the ball is way too small and the rope is too Thin not a good investment</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog likes this toy a lot, however it's not a very well designed tug toy! Major rope burn happens when you try to pull. The knot on the end isn't big enough to be a good grip.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This is a really cool dog toy!  It also makes it easier for me to retrieve the ball to throw it again since there is a rope.  My dog enjoys the rope as well as the ball.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">The rope is nylon and shredded in minutes. Thin and cheap and not made to last. The ball is fine, but I didn't buy just a ball, did I? Very disappointing.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Throat came untied within 10 minutes and due to the type of rope it is not easily inserted back inside the ball. I would not recommend this and I would not buy it again</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This toy last less than an hour out of the box. My frenchie who is a gnawer was able to take this thing apart in about 45 minutes. I thought with the KONG name it would last some time. Nope, not with Max!</span>]\n",

My dog likes to drop her balls in her water bowl when we take a break and these don’t need to be dried out for days like tennis balls.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I bought this product because all the comments said how strong the toy is and how long it lasted. Unfortunately, my two year old Am Staff was able to destroy it in LESS than a WEEK! If you have a dog with a strong jaw and loves to chew this product might not be ideal if your looking for a toy to last longer than a week   Pretty disappointed.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Got this for a friend’s Rottie-Shepherd mix, and it’s still intact after two weeks’ free access. He’s not a typical power-chewer: rather, his favorite hobby is figuring out how to take things apart. He finds a toy’s weak spot with shepherd’s determination, focus, and sheer bliss for creative problem solving; and then applies the full bite strength of his likely breed mix to systematically and joyously dismantle it like a kid with a Christmas box. His house is littered with tiny fragments of top-brand tough toys - hard rubber reduced to confetti, hard plastic puzzle toys confiscated when the plastic began cracking, scraps of reinforced seams, with the alleged puncture-proof kevlar and stuffing</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog loves these balls and this is a nice size so I don’t have to worry about her accidentally swallowing it. We kick it off the porch and it goes sailing across the yard and she loves to chase after it that way. She has popped  the smaller size so we went to this bigger one and it seems to be holding up fine for now.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I’ve got 3 heelers all in different sizes. I got the x-large chuckit ball because the medium ones always roll under the couch and this one doesn’t! All 3 dogs including my mini heeler can carry the ball around in their mouth and all 3 love it. Now I need to buy more since the fur kids don’t know how to share lol.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My German Shepherd’s and Belgian melon law love love love these balls! They of course have crazy #BAL Drive and these check it balls can with stand there chewing and last forever! The squeaker in this one actually doesn’t really squeak, I don’t know if it’s just this one or if they all just make like an air switch sound. But that’s OK with me LOL!</span>]\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog loves this ball! She loves being able to chew on it. She is a 6.5 year old 18 lb Boston Terrier and not a power chewer but she is still a chewer. This has been a durable ball for her. This probably would not be the best ball for a strong or power chewer. Our only disappointment is the squeaker broke within the first few days of her playing with it. It is a very affordable toy and worth the small cost to replace it because our pup loves it so much. She likes all her toys but I honestly think this is her favorite. I would recommend and have recommended this ball. I have given this ball to my mother and brother who both have 30lb Australian Shepherds. Both of the Australian Shepherds love</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Yuba LOVES this darn thing. She actually \"found\" this ball 2x before I figured out what it was and ordered it. First, she found one at a lake and would not let it go - sadly we learned it belonged to another dog. When she \"found\" it again at another lake, she took off to play independently with it and would not let me near her to take it away!  The other hoomans did not seem impressed. I went home that day and ordered 2! I remove it after a certain amount of play because the squeaking does get a little annoying... I would also agree with other reviews that the packaging is not great - poorly designed with tiny plastic pieces pierced through the ball.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My Chinese Crested of 19lbs, absolutely loves these squeaky balls. He has small, medium and large. For some reason he loves the large one best, but plays with them all. Funny thing is that the large one has the highest pitch squeal when you squeeze it, and the other two are more normal. The large one sounds like a large bird and even though he has tiny teeth, it takes him longer to pick up the large one and he doesn’t care if it just takes him a few more seconds then picking up the others and he is happy as can be throwing it into the air, chasing it, or just sleeping with them. One of the best toys, for sure.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I make sure I have these balls with me in the house, car, and my pocket when walking. The three I keep in my car are for when we go to a park.  The small balls fit in the \"ChuckIt\" stick for tennis balls.  The one in my pocket is to get my dogs attention when another dog approaches.  The ball squeaks and he responds every time.  I definitely have to have at least three for inside.  I bought some medium and large ones for my friends large golden retriever.  He hoards them and loves them.  My little dog can also pick up the medium balls.  I highly recommend these gems.  I wouldn't want to be without them.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have 110 lb. Bernese Mtn Dog, and this is by far his favorite toy!   It's a big substitute also for chewing on things you don't want chewed.   We play with it in the house and outside.  It has a nice bounce so when I can get it away from him we play fetch and he can catch it on the bounce!   I order one a month because after a few weeks of chewing , water and slobber it deflates a bit and  little foam pieces come out.  I've tried other firmer squeaky balls the same size but none catches his attention over this one!    And so easy with Chewy to come with his auto ship.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Goldie (Akita mix) has plenty of balls but the Hartz Dura Play balls in all sizes are her absolute favorite! It may be because they are bacon scented. They are tough and she loves their squeak and the way they bounce. After dinner, we have to \"play ball\"  and she never gets tired of them. She was a rescued mother dog and it is heart warming to see her have so much fun playing.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">One of my dogs is very mellow and shy.  But once you take this ball out she goes NUTS! It is the only toy we can get her to go crazy about and she will play fetch with it all day.  It is strictly and outside toy in our household because she squeaks it so much!  I highly recommend this toy to anyone!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Not sure why this ball is so better than all others. But my ball obsessed doodle loves it. It is a mess to clean up if he gets to the foam so the second I see a hole it goes in the trash and I order 5 more. When I’m tired I have to hide it. The other reviews are right the squeaker is loud and annoying but it only lasts a few days.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We got our 7-week old lab puppy last week and she absolutely adored this ball! She could only really roll it around and jump on it but now it fits in her mouth. She likes how it smells like bacon and squeaks. She is literally the toughest chewer I've ever met for a pup her age. We tried out the Kong rope toys and within 2 days the squeaker and rope were pulled out and the squirrels head was pulled off. This ball has magically held up (for 1 and a half weeks!) and we'll certainly purchase again!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Lasted about 2 weeks for my staffy pup. Getting the ball out of the packaging was a lousy experience. This is the loudest squeaker i've ever heard, way too loud! There is a layer of foam between two layers of rubber so if the rubber gets punctured, your pup will have access to a \"stuffing\" and that's annoying to clean up and monitor as well.  Did not know it was scented, either. It has a strong odor to it which made it hard to put away and not have my pup sniffing for it.</span>\n",
