It's easy to throw with the attached rope and it floats above the water so it's easy for a dog to see.  It seems impervious to pond water muck and leeches.  Our dog does not chew on this toy so I can't speak for that aspect, but in all other ways, it works perfectly.</span>,\n",

       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We've used this for several swims now. It stays afloat, and the bright color makes it easy for the pups to track. The cutest thing ever is when my pup and my parent's pup retrieve it together. Definitely worth the money!</span>,\n",

My 10 month old GSD LOVED these but the stitching starting coming apart on day one and the bumpers were completely destroyed by day 2.

Very poorly constructed.</span>,\n",

I saw the plastic pieces and checked for the squeaker and couldn’t find it. Got a bit worried so I cut a slit in the other end and was happy to see there is no plastic squeaker! It’s a tube inside the bulb, and hollow otherwise. I’m not sure that I’d buy this again, given it didn’t hold up like the black Kong products do, but it’s good to know there’s no squeaker hazard. And the end I cut still squeaks!</span>,\n",

I don't necessarily like getting smacked in the leg by it when he shakes it like a squirrel, lol, but he has so much fun with it I'm willing to let that go. It's big enough for tug of war, tough enough for chewing, and squeaks just enough for him to stay interested but not so much that everyone in the room gets a headache. Definitely one of our favorite toys.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This toy held up for 2 months with my dog primarily playing fetch on land and in water. The true test began when I started taking it with us to the dog park. It survived for several play sessions, but once the dogs started tugging on it they were able to rip the bulbs off the end. However, I would purchase again as it’s a durable toy and it provided my pittie with many enjoyable play sessions.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This toy is unbelievably fun for my dogs.  It is sturdy for my chewers, who usually demolish toys within minutes.  The squeaking stimulates them to step on it, carry it around, toss it from their mouths and try to play tug o war.  It's a tough toy, and I'm so glad I discovered it for my doggies.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog (2 year old border collie), destroys everything I get him that says it’s for tough chewers and it’s really frustrating when you drop a good amount of money on it. But this one is affordable and he has a blast with it. It’s perfect length for tug of war plus the squeakers get him even more excited. \n",
       "   Would definitely recommend:)</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our Goldendoodle is a toy destroyer and this one doesn’t even have a tooth mark on it after a couple weeks of play. He loves to use those tiny front teeth to try to pull the seams apart. Both ends are squeakers which is a great surprise and joy to our pup. Great toy for fetch and doesn’t bounce super high so safer for indoor tossing as well.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My 50lb bully destroys everything she that goes into her mouth. I've had one of these babies for almost 9 months. While she did shred the squeakers on the ends within one month, the center stick has continued to last. It's her absolute favorite toy and she carries it almost everywhere. She's been slowly biting off bits from the ends but it's a pretty solid stick so it will take her a while. I bought 2 more and give her access to the new ones that still have intact squeakers every now and then, but otherwise she's perfectly happy with her squeaker-less center stick piece.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My lab usually destroys everything and we have had issues in the past with toys. So he doesn’t have many. Kong came through again with this toy. It has held up and makes him happy. I find my dog napping with it.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I really like this toy and I had very high hopes that it would last. I have two strong chewers and they chewed through the end after having the toy only two days. But even busted, I can still throw it around and play fetch with it.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My pit LOVES to chew his toys especially squeaking ones they are his favorite but his 1st goal is to get to that squeaker. Anyways this is in my top 5 toys I can get him that actually lasts. Yes he had those squeakers broken the 1st day but he still loves to chew on this and it hasnt been chewed up yet so I will for sure buy again for him.</span>]},\n",

Well there is zero spearmint smell.  Hard to explain the smell but best I can compare to is a dirty barn ..  no idea why but the smell I believe is a deterrent for my dog, as he wants nothing to do with it.... sadly another chewy item that cannot use.  Maybe a shelter can use it as my dog didn’t touch it but not sure I feel right even donating it due to the smell /.

The material, however, is not very chew resistant and considering that this is supposed to be a chew toy, we were very disappointed.

She's still a puppy so I dont know how it will hold up for extreme chewers but she loves it.</span>,\n",

However, two of my tough chewers have been gnawing on it all day for two days and it is perfectly in tact. I am sure over time it will break down but it’s nice to know that it is durable enough to hopefully get my money’s worth first! I think it helped that I bought a medium instead of a small size for the pugs because they really had to work at it to chew on it- but the crackle had them so obsessed that they managed to do it.</span>,\n",

Didn't have a problem with the durability until she had the toy (and had used it quite a bit) for about 4-5 months. Then she started to be able to pull away the rubber coating and pull out the plastic inside, so it quickly went in the trash. Overall a pretty good toy!</span>,\n",

Know your chewer before you purchase this. My mini poodle mix would probably hang on to this for a long time. But its first day with my bf’s retriever puppy, his teeth pierced through and it’s slowly being ripped up.

The material is not strong enough for chewers and is easily pierced by teeth; however, the noise it makes is pretty fun. Even I liked twisting it to make the noises. It lasted just around a month and I did not let my dog play with it without supervision, otherwise she would eat the pieces.</span>,\n",

My 2 dogs both love the variety. I tried to get a picture before they started playing with the toys, but they couldn't wait, so 1 is missing from the picture! These are an excellent variety for the price and hold up very well. Its been a few days since our order, so I wanted to be true to my review.

       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I've seen a lot of bad reviews saying that their dogs have ripped this toy to shreds. One thing I want to mention is that this is NOT to be used as a chew toy it's an INTERACTIVE toy which is written on the package when you get it. So if you have no intentions of actually playing with your dog don't buy this. You can save some money but buying a bone instead. I have an 80lb pitty who destroys \"durable\" toys like it's his job. He however hasn't destroyed this one yet and the reason why is not because it's \"indestructible\" but because when I'm done playing with this toy it gets put up until next time increasing it's usability. My only real complaint is that the holes are a bit small for my average</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">One of the best toys ever purchased!! We have a Dane that is an aggressive chewer and love to play tug o war!! This is fantastic!!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Decent pull toy, I think ropes last longer for tug wars than this. He tends to bite on the edges of the toy more, and the seams are coming undone. He killed the squeakers in about 15 minutes of play time. He is a mild chewer.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This is a very rugged toy, and my power-chewer hasn't put a dent in it in. But that's really all I can say for it. Too big and too ungainly for my girl. I wish I'd gone for a smaller toy for her. I'd recommend this item for a larger dog that is a strong chewer.\n",

       "   \n",
       "   Cons:\n",
       "   1) It's just too big and unwieldy for her. She's a big, tall hound dog with a long muzzle, so toys for \"medium sized dogs\" don't usually stand up to her chewing efforts, that's</span>,\n",

I have special indoor/outdoor toys based on how I know my dog plays. She likes to chew when she’s relaxing/before bed but she likes to run around and play tug, and generally doesn’t chew, when outdoors. This is a perfect outdoor toy and she is obsessed with it! It’s the first toy she runs to when she wants to play in the yard. But will it break if your dog is an aggressive chewer? Yes, it’s not made of tough rubber and string can never hold up well to a rough chewer. But can it stand up to tug, absolutely (but again that depends on how your dog plays/if they’re playing with a friend). If you’re</span>,\n",

She hasn't managed to destroy the squeaker yet, despite being a dog who will lie there and repeatedly bite down on it, again and again and again and...I remind myself I love my dog.

Tho nothing is dog proof this stuff held up much much longer than any other brand !! The squirrel flyer etc were shredded right off but these huge balls , rollers etc he has taken care of- I’d given this away to my next  door neighbors dog who adored it ! I had to give it to him bc he had so much joy for it ! Haha! \n",

       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My pup is OBSESSED with this thing.  As a fetch and tug addict, it is absolutely perfect for her.  I first found one at TJMaxx and she played with it for many months, maybe even a year, before she managed to dismantle it (which is pretty impressive, given that she can destroy a stuffed animal in less than 10 minutes).  I was so happy to find it on Chewy!  Unfortunately, the seams on the one I ordered started to rip in just a couple of hours and after few weeks it is completely trashed.  Hoping that I just received a defective product?  I'm back here ordering another one (lol) and keeping my fingers crossed!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This toy is of high quality, similar to the other Chuckit! products. This toy was much larger than I pictured it being and is a little challenging/awkward to throw. I have a 62 pound dog and his front leg has gone through the hole when catching it--I'm not super worried about him getting hurt playing with this but it's not out of the picture. He doesn't seem to mind and wants to play with it often!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have never felt the need/desire to write a review on a dog toy before. Well, this toy has made my almost one year old, Belgian Tervuren the happiest dog ever! He is constantly bringing me this toy to throw for him, to fetch, all day long. There are those few moments when he'll kind of share it with his German Shepard sister, and play tug of war. She is seldom allowed to play with it alone. I have never seen him so in love with a toy before. It seems very well made to withstand all of his abuse. Thank you so much for making this toy!!</span>,\n",

       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have bought this ring over and over. My dogs are hard on toys, but this one is one of their favorites. This last time I ordered an extra because they go through them. Doesn't mean they aren't strong or worth it, just means my dogs are rough on them.

He ripped right through it and shredded it without us knowing. He tore out the stuffing and squeaker then ate some of the rope and fabric. Had to take him to the vet because the rope didn't pass through him without help!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our 8 month puppy is completely into demolishing his toys right now. He’s really exercising his jaws and teeth. So I don’t expect toys to last too long. I did think this rope toy would last longer than an hour. He found the weakness in a side seam and the toy was beyond repair. We still let him play with it but had to remove any stuffing. I think it’s a great toy if your pup wants to play tug of war and isn’t so much into tug and  destroy.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I buy and endorse Kong toys on a regular basis, but this one was a disappointment.  The tug ropes on each end are too small for an adult hand to hang onto,  The squeaker is a HUGE disappointment.  It is located in just one of the legs and very hard to find.  It barely squeaked.  The inside of the toy is rope like the handles, but it's not a chew toy, so I'm confused.  It was a gift for a friend's new puppy - he didn't seem intrigued.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">we received this as a gift to our new puppy who’s 9mo. It broke within ten seconds of her playing with it. The ropes completely tore apart and our puppy was eating them within a blink of an eye—I’m not kidding. I wish I was. I’ve never seen a dog toy rip apart so easily. Our puppy is 50lbs and not a very aggressive chewer so it was quite startling to have the toy completely break and fall apart within seconds of having it. I had to cut the rope part off just so she could still remotely play with it since she was starting to try to eat the torn rope ends. I would not recommend this toy unless your dog literally does chew at all.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Both my 80+ lb boxer dogs love this toy. They play tug a war. It has held up well and this is my second one of this style, the other was a monkey I bought quite a while ago, he is still surviving.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">It is recommended as a tough chew toy, but my dogs had both the fluff and the rope ends pulled out within an hour. Very disappointed.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Archie was able to completely deconstruct this thing rather quickly; even the tug o’ war element. I realize nothing lasts forever, especially when given to a 80lb monster with jaws of steel. However, the people at Kong are wacky if they think this product is a deal at nearly $20. Not the worst, but certainly not a house favorite.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We thought we’d give Kong tuggerknots toys a try, as they have a good reputation for quality. Our Airedales love to play with relatively soft toys, especially with a squeaker, but they have a knack for chewing off the fabric. I wish Kong would make a plush like toy for dogs who need to use the black Kong for biting (they can destroy the red ones). Still on the hunt for the elusive perfect plush toy for hard chewers.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog peeled the felt off of the middle in a matter of minutes.  I was surprised because Kong toys usually last longer.  I ended up throwing it away.</span>,\n",

He definitely did love this toy as promised but had it destroyed within 2 hours. The handles knawed apart and the inner rope exposed. He had a great time with the toy, it's just not as long lasting as claimed.</span>]},\n",

One loves to bring it to us and have it tossed up in the air so that he can jump up and catch it. His younger sister grabs hold of the other end and the tug of war begins. It does eventually look rather ragged and I trim some of the strings. They like to pull on them and grab the squeaky middle toy. They do not have any issue concerning eating of the stringy parts. I usually add this in my monthly subscription so that I will have one when one needs to be replaced.</span>,\n",

One dog can destroy one in less than 7 minutes but has such joy doing it. I try to limit the time and rotate toys to make them last. It also helps if i can play by throwing and chasing.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My two boys love their new toys, they play with the ropes together and have made a new friend out of one of the toys, taking it to bed with them every night. Great quality for a bull dog and pitbull who love to tear everything apart!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have two medium-large dogs, Pitbull and Black Mouth Cur. They both love playing with toys. One of them plays with her toys most of the day, a chewer. These ropes are strong and well made. Ropes don't usually last long in our house, but these ones actually have. I'm very happy that I ordered this!! I plan to order this again soon :)\n",

       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I gave the items to my german shepard while I was playing tough a war with dog it broke and I nearly hit my head from falling. I would not recommend for large dogs.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">We bought this for our new bundle of energy, just for the rope toys. We didn’t expect much from the ball, thinking it would be just a nice add on that wouldn’t last with our pup’s jaws...WRONG! That ball is the best part of the bundle (and first thing he lost in our woods!). And Pacific Pups seems to be a company that cares!</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My American Staffordshire/pit mix is a power chewer, and most off-the-shelf rope toys from major retailers don't last more than a few days.  Time will tell if these ropes can break the record, but I got three of them, plus a solid ball for fetch (AND some pet waste bags as an added treat), for the price I'd pay for one otherwise.  Definitely a bargain.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">The rope toys and Stand-alone ball are very sturdy and I would have given this Purchase a 5, except for the inclusion of the “rope” ball, which was very flimsy and easily pulled apart into many little pieces of wool. Overall, pack is worth the price, but don’t plan on the ball on the rope lasting for long.</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Got this pack thinking my GSD could have a rope for the yard, house and travel but he had the first one chewed thru within 2 hours. The ball on the other hand has held up well but the price for a ball is a bit high. If ropes well tougher I'd have given it 5*</span>,\n",
       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Bought this item for my dog's birthday and unfortunately when the package arrived it was missing one of the rope toys. I contacted customer service and received a fast response and resolution! Giving 4 stars because of the missing item, but the items that were received are as advertised and the ball especially seems very durable for my German Shepherd. He was very happy with the purchase :)</span>,\n",

But we made the mistake of letting him chew on it for 4.5min longer than previously allowed, and the next time I looked over it was 100% ANNIHILATED.

       "   <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dogs are what all \"tough chewer\" toy manufacturers should use to determine if their toys are truly unbreakable. I had the highest of hopes for this one! They pulled, they tugged, they chewed they ran around throwing it in the air like a dead snake, I was SO EXCITED and ready to buy 3 more. Then one of them finally achieved their goal of destruction and chewed off the end. But it lasted a good 4-5 hours! I would highly recommend this toy for almost any other dog.

She usually ends up breaking up the rope and does chew through it, but it takes her a couple weeks to get through them. They come in handy for tug of war and chewing! Every time I bring one home or get it delivered, she is beyond excited. We both LOVE these ropes!</span>,\n",

The boys love it!</span>,\n",

Unfortunately, just a day after a bought a new one, the dogs were playing tug-o-war and the rope pulled out because the knot was not big enough. Now I'm left with a ball that is incredibly hard to play with and a rope that the dogs have minimal interest in. This has happened before but not so shortly after receiving it! Why can't they make the knots a little more substantial so that this doesn't happen?

She loves regular Jolly Balls, but after a couple of weeks of play would rip the handles off of them from swinging them around. This version of the toy is great in that it has a rope through it that she can use to swing the ball around instead of an attached handle that can break off. The ball itself is much more rigid than a straight Jolly Ball, and feels a little heavier, but that doesn't stop her from whipping it around. Highly recommend for larger, strong dogs who like a good game of tug or for dogs who like to roughhouse with big toys.</span>,\n",

He is an avid chewer, but he is not as hard on toys as my other dog. Both of my dogs are fine with these though, and they hold up well. For reference, both of my dogs are medium build. My male dog is a lab mix, and my female dog is a pitt mix.  We have bought other West Paw toys with a lot of success.

We have had one for several weeks and played with almost daily and so far it is unscathed.

The only problem was it was short enough that we could really play tug-of-war. Then he killed it about a month later. He was devastated. I tried the Mammoth size and it's HUGE!

She likes to chase it, run past it then maybe eventually bring it back(she is not the the best at fetch)!  What she does do though is carry it around and chews it...it has lasted so far.  So in all seriousness, when this toy finally gives out(which is not for a while yet by the looks of it), we'll be getting her another one.</span>,\n",

The fabric weave is too loose and the seams are at the edge, proving too irresistible to inquiring puppy teeth. He went through the fabric seams in 1 minute!

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog LOVES chewing his toys and tearing them apart. Unless I’m getting him a toy that I know is gonna last, I typically buy him the cheapest ones since they won’t last more than 20 minutes. I thought  these balls would only last a day or two max, but we’re going on a week AND THERES NOT EVEN A DENT!! \n",
      "\n",
      "He absolutely loves these balls. They’re scented too which I thinks makes him like them even more- but we have an indoor one and an outside one since he cuddles this toy and tries his darn best to chew it. Also, it’s $4 cheaper on chewy than petsmart.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Our young pup loves this ball! She is an extreme chewer and does not play traditional \"fetch\". Instead, she loves to have the ball bounced so that she can chase it down and take it somewhere in the yard to chew. We have had this ball for about 2 months and so far no damage. It has outlived every toy other than the extreme medium Kong toy. The ball bounces high and is great for pups that like to pounce. The best toy we have bought for the price.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dog was chewing tennis balls, ripping off the soft threads.  Then I got these.  He plays with them all day - either fetching or just chewing.  He's a very hard chewer but I don't think he'll ever destroy these!  They are the size of tennis balls and if they get too dirty or slobbery, they are easy to wash.  I would definately recommend these!!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I can't say enough about these balls. I got the two-pack. The colors are bright and do not fade. They get a lot of daily use as they are the favorite out of all the balls I've bought for Benny. He loves to chew and seems to need a lot of exercise for his mouth. These are roughly the size of a tennis ball and virtually indestructible! My dog loves to chew and chew on these and after months they are holding up great! We play a catch game with these and with all the chewing they continue to bounce too! These are a must have for any dog!</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have a 1 year old pitbull/husky &amp; usually she can go through a tennis ball in 15 mins. Decided to try chuckit! &amp; so far it’s going great. Good bounce &amp; very durable. No holes or teeth marks at all. I chuck the ball in the basement all day &amp; she’ll bring it back looking like it did the day I gave it to her</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Small enough for little mouths of Yorkies. We don’t chuck them, we just bounce them around in the house and the girls chew on them. It has helped with the plaque on the canines, which is a bonus. \n",

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My pup destroys even the seemingly most durable toys and this ball has survived its first day unscathed. She has spent a few hours working on it and no marks yet. I give this my highest durability rating for being able to survive a single day- that doesn’t often happen with new toys here!</span>\n",

It’s the equivalent of giving a toddler a noisy toy, and your pup will be obsessed. I love seeing how happy he is, and the sound really doesn’t bother me! Especially since he’s been destroying things in the house lately, meaning that whenever I hear the toy, I know he is behaving! He carries it around the house, play bows to it, bats it around to make more noise, it’s incredible. What a happy and engaged pup!</span>\n",

She looks toward the cubby hole where I store it each day when she thinks it's time to play.  I put it down on the floor and she chases it all over the house, pushing it with her nose and barking the entire time.  She only stops when she needs a drink of water or she's just exhausted.  If you have a dog that loves to play and isn't afraid of crazy, wacky sounds, this might be the toy you're looking for.  It seems to be well constructed too, so I expect it to last a while.</span>\n",

At first, he was a little afraid of it and barked at it after he pushed it around and it made noise.  Then I followed the instructions and said, \"good boy\" each time he made it make a sound.  Right after that, he was pushing it all over, having a blast.  He kept playing long after I walked into the next room.  Within a few minutes, he figured out how to pick it up in his mouth and carry it.  I'd say this one is a hit!!  :)</span>\n",

The squeaker is a good noise level (Kong really knows how to make squeakers that aren’t absolutely annoying). The squeaker lasted decently long as far as squeakers go. Once that broke it took a long time for the actual toy to break (maybe a month) he eventually broke the seal on one end. Luckily it only has one piece that falls out. It was thrown away then.

It's a shame. She really loves these balls but we can't afford to give her a new ball every other day.</span>]\n",

The dog likes to chew on the ball (as if she's chewing gum) and the ball is still whole.... i love this!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My dogs love this ball. It was sort of disappointing though because it didn't make a whistling sound when you throw it. It doesn't seem to matter how hard you throw it. They still like it anyway.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Disappointed that these balls do not whistle when thrown.  I would not have purchased them had I read that you have to buy the launcher to get the whistle sound.  The balls themselves are O.K. and my dog plays with them.</span>]\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">This seems like it would be a good toy for dogs that love to fetch and play with balls. Almost immediately after giving it to my dog, I noticed there were breaks in the rubber and it was coming apart. We did not fetch or tug with it, my dog was just running around the yard carrying it and pushing it around. It wasn’t completely broken, so we shoved a chuckit breathe right ball inside to keep her occupied and she was easily able to break chunks off of this ball and tear it apart. We had to take it away and throw it in the garbage so she didn’t eat any little pieces. Might be good if you have a very gentle dog, but it won’t stand up to tug or any rough play with a 75lb GSD. I won’t order again.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I ordered this because my puppy loves to chew on things and chews through everything that I get him that is made up of some sort of fabric.

Thinking that the medium with the next size I ordered it and it’s so large and heavy, It’s bigger than his head and too much for him to carry he doesn’t like it. So it’s disappointing. Not the toys fault, it’s my fault that I wasted the money because he can’t play with it Because it’s too heavy for him to pick up. He’s a king Charles spaniel</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have a 3 1/2-month-old Catahoula Leopard Dog/Border Collie mix puppy who needs lots of play, especially due to his mix of breeds. Being a puppy, he wants to chew on everything and his mix makes him a strong chewer, even at his age. He also loves to play fetch (well, his version of it) and tug-of-war. I got this in a large as I didn't want to have to constantly rescue it from under the couch or other furniture. I've had this for 1 1/2 months and so far it has stood up wonderfully to his chewing on it and can withstand our vigorous games of tug-of-war (for \"drop-it\" training). It still looks like new.

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I bought 2 of these balls after seeing a Pinterest project. The ball was stuffed with ribbons/strips of fabric for the dogs to pull out.

Well worth the money. I am considering buying the smaller sizes as well.</span>\n",

      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My young greyhound is a squeaky ball destroyer, so I buy toys that claim to be rugged or indestructible. The squeaker lasted a little more than half an hour. For this doggie, that's a long time! The good news is that it is easy to find inexpensive replacement squeakers on the internet. For this toy, the ones listed at 15-16mm long are the right size. Weirdly enough, the replacement squeakers often last longer than the original.\n",
      "After a several of hours of play, the surface of the ball is still intact, which is lovely, compared to most other toys I've gotten for her. The ball has a nice high bounce and she loves chasing it.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have several super-chewer dogs. I ordered two large and one medium of these gnawsome squeaker balls. I was positive they’d be destroyed within hours. It’s now been eight days and all the toys are in perfect shape. I’m not saying your dog won’t destroy these, but my Malinois and hound dog, who both notoriously shred every toy they are given, are still happily playing. The plastic is more durable than I expected and they have good bounce. My pups love to squeak these dang things so much I barely get a break, which isn’t awesome while holed up at home... and all my friends now ask if I have a bird when we talk over the phone. But indoor fetch is more exciting than ever and it makes me happy to</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Purchased this item not sure if it would be too small for my great dane, but it was Perfect! The squeak really keeps her entertained and she will even play by herself sometimes . She enjoys it and looks forward to \"playtime\". Durable quality, bought 2 and both are still in tact. First one lost a little \"bounce\" but second one is still going strong.</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">As mentioned in other reviews, Spikes do reduce the speed with which Puppy destroys the toy, as she seems to enjoy the feeling of nubs.  Once she got a hole in it, she then made progress in disassembly each time she had it. We use it for her to chase (She’s not a retriever!) and remove it soon after.  If she were allowed to chew at will, it would be destroyed in a short time.</span>\n",

She recently destroyed her last one and I have looked every-where and bought a dozen others over the last few months.

Not having the actual manufacturer and only pieces of the old one from which to estimate the size, I took a chance on these.  She was skeptical at first, but once she played with it a little and we played catch a time or two, she realized that indeed \"Squeaky Ball\" is BACK!!  Thank you, Thank you!  You've made my little 12lb Terrorist a very happy girl again!!</span>\n",

      "Toy Reviews: [<span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My young greyhound is a squeaky ball destroyer, so I buy toys that claim to be rugged or indestructible. The squeaker lasted a little more than half an hour. For this doggie, that's a long time! The good news is that it is easy to find inexpensive replacement squeakers on the internet. For this toy, the ones listed at 15-16mm long are the right size. Weirdly enough, the replacement squeakers often last longer than the original.\n",
      "After a several of hours of play, the surface of the ball is still intact, which is lovely, compared to most other toys I've gotten for her. The ball has a nice high bounce and she loves chasing it.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">I have several super-chewer dogs. I ordered two large and one medium of these gnawsome squeaker balls. I was positive they’d be destroyed within hours. It’s now been eight days and all the toys are in perfect shape. I’m not saying your dog won’t destroy these, but my Malinois and hound dog, who both notoriously shred every toy they are given, are still happily playing. The plastic is more durable than I expected and they have good bounce. My pups love to squeak these dang things so much I barely get a break, which isn’t awesome while holed up at home... and all my friends now ask if I have a bird when we talk over the phone. But indoor fetch is more exciting than ever and it makes me happy to</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">Purchased this item not sure if it would be too small for my great dane, but it was Perfect! The squeak really keeps her entertained and she will even play by herself sometimes . She enjoys it and looks forward to \"playtime\". Durable quality, bought 2 and both are still in tact. First one lost a little \"bounce\" but second one is still going strong.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">As mentioned in other reviews, Spikes do reduce the speed with which Puppy destroys the toy, as she seems to enjoy the feeling of nubs.  Once she got a hole in it, she then made progress in disassembly each time she had it. We use it for her to chase (She’s not a retriever!) and remove it soon after.  If she were allowed to chew at will, it would be destroyed in a short time.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">My Boston Terrier is possessed when it comes to playing with this ball. It is the perfect size for her and with the squeaker in it, she goes crazy when catching it. The rubber spikes all over the exterior of the ball also massage her mouth when catching and chewing on it. I bought two of them and will have to get more as she will go through them as much and often as she plays with them.</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">These balls are my yorkie / terrier mix's favorite!  She recently destroyed her last one and I have looked every-where and bought a dozen others over the last few months.  She refused to play with any of them and just looked at me with such a pitiful look that none of them was her \"squeaky ball\".  Not having the actual manufacturer and only pieces of the old one from which to estimate the size, I took a chance on these.  She was skeptical at first, but once she played with it a little and we played catch a time or two, she realized that indeed \"Squeaky Ball\" is BACK!!  Thank you, Thank you!  You've made my little 12lb Terrorist a very happy girl again!!</span>, <span class=\"ugc-list__review__display\">my dog likes those squeaker balls and other toys and somehow finds a way to chew the squeaker out and rip them apart so i decided to get a ball a little bigger for his size and it’s still brand new !!!

She lost her first one but our local pet store didn’t have a large Chuck It Ultra so I tried tennis balls but those got destroyed within a day, and other rubber balls just didn’t make her as happy as her Chuck It did! Thankfully Chewy had a really good deal on Large Chuck It balls so I FINALLY got one. My dog was ECSTATIC! She would play and play and play until she is desperate for water!

Bounces really well on (hard) grass and other surfaces and the orange color means we find it in the weeds. I've ordered more in case we lose it, not because it was falling apart.
